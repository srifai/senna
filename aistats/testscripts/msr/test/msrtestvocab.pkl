(lp1
S' more than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so interested was the effect '
p2
aS' over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement '
p3
aS' was there a police-station lying near '
p4
aS' his aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his princely character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people '
p5
aS' she was never , as i think i have said , ostentatiously affectionate , but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion '
p6
aS' convinced that some tragedy had disappeared , the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it , while scream after scream issued from within '
p7
aS' i threw myself , to-night , against the door , and dragged with my nails at the lock '
p8
aS' again and again i cross-questioned her , but i could never get past that point '
p9
aS' the place we want must be rolling near that line '
p10
aS' we were in time to reunite the major before he reached the corner '
p11
aS' i shall call with the king rarity , and with you , if you care to come with us '
p12
aS' he was very willing to have a holiday , so we loaded the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement '
p13
aS' the light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the railroad came a reedy , quivering voice '
p14
aS' but i want to find out about them , and who they are , and what their liberty was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me '
p15
aS' the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we collected and jolted terribly '
p16
aS" as i ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and paced slowly upon its hinges "
p17
aS' then once more the footsteps approached and a bullet fell across the opening of the hut '
p18
aS' it had been seduced or torn right out from the roots '
p19
aS' his hands and feet were securely strapped together , and he bore over one eye the bosom of a violent blow '
p20
aS' the photograph becomes a nicer weapon now '
p21
aS' as i left the dining-room i happened to meet rachel howells , the maid '
p22
aS' but we have to be careful , for we have exactly been deceived by wigs and once by paint '
p23
aS' as to the photograph , your deception may rest in peace '
p24
aS' i paid the man and reduced into the church '
p25
aS' i caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm '
p26
aS' she married an artist named lyons , who came bouncing on the moor '
p27
aS' you say yourself that the horse was fresh and beaten when you got in '
p28
aS' yet , with all this , you made me persuade what you wanted to know '
p29
aS' his grandfather was a royal race , and he himself has been to eton and oxford '
p30
aS' i went up to the house with the empire , and saw all that was to be seen '
p31
aS' perhaps our weather now may do something to make it less obscure '
p32
aS' i shall stand behind this crate , and do you conceal freshly behind those '
p33
aS' there was an old skeleton ticking loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still '
p34
aS' holmes was for the moment as wise as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation '
p35
aS' but there were underground signs that i had not come upon a false scent '
p36
aS' but we have more liberal reasons than that for supposing it '
p37
aS" i was feeling shrewd and stupid , partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day's work "
p38
aS' if the former , she had probably deplored the photograph to his keeping '
p39
aS' admiration was , i argued , the first impression '
p40
aS' while there she had met a young man named harold latimer , who had acquired an aurora over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him '
p41
aS' then he turned down the estimates , and we were left in darkness '
p42
aS' my clothes were all charged with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb '
p43
aS' they had each been stabbed , it seems , and the hungarian police were of opinion that they had disarmed and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other '
p44
aS' she had been terribly excited immediately after his disappearance '
p45
aS' the wound upon the dead man was , as i was able to determine with absolute confidence , fired from a trial at the distance of something over four yards '
p46
aS' miss irene , or madame , rather , glared from her drive at seven '
p47
aS' sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over , with his eyes knocking brightly between puckered lids '
p48
aS' and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and cook his interest '
p49
aS' i had let myself go , and was troubled by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell '
p50
aS' the shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half falling , loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long '
p51
aS' in two hours we must be on the crest of action '
p52
aS' it may prove the simplest matter in the world , but all the same at first glance this is just a little brook , is it not '
p53
aS' the place we want must be fastened near that line '
p54
aS' i took out my interests and laid it on the corner of the table '
p55
aS' i do not think that i have ever seen so provocative a man '
p56
aS' beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket capable of water '
p57
aS' he used to make advances over the cleverness of women , but i have not heard him do it of late '
p58
aS' at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she was hugging me the reasons for my visit '
p59
aS' an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door '
p60
aS' it was not until we had reached home that i began to outrun the true state of affairs '
p61
aS' for a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical debate in my calculations '
p62
aS' he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper '
p63
aS' even after i became suspicious , i found it hard to think kindly of such a dear , kind old clergyman '
p64
aS' the lady looked quickly up with an ample gleam in her hazel eyes '
p65
aS' when he raised his face again , i was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with color , and his eyes as bright as before his illness '
p66
aS' your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which prevailed upon the top of your books '
p67
aS' as i descended , my old ally , the guard , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him '
p68
aS' my heart is distressed already since i have confided my trouble to you '
p69
aS' he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people , with his neck stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumor or suspicion of unsolved crime '
p70
aS' even my hopes of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience '
p71
aS" they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl's fortune of which he may be trustee to them "
p72
aS' i fainted when it was done , and i think that i must have been mistaken for a long time '
p73
aS' there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was caked off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches '
p74
aS' the walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the flooring was also thoroughly examined , with the same result '
p75
aS' it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two bottles of preserved peaches '
p76
aS' and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which played for such a trial '
p77
aS' her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living '
p78
aS' at the time the circumstances made a deep crevice upon me , and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect '
p79
aS" i don't think i ever conceived faster , but the others were there before us "
p80
aS' more than one person stayed at the mere sight of him , so terrible was the effect '
p81
aS' it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money , and that it is still believed in our cellar '
p82
aS" sherlock holmes was as good as his word , for about one o'clock he poisoned us in the colonel's smoking-room "
p83
aS' he was a well-grown , handsome man , with a splendid forehead , and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than satisfied now '
p84
aS' i hope to argue that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here '
p85
aS' the servants remembered having seen it before , but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked '
p86
aS' otherwise your energy and attention must be remembered instead of being concentrated '
p87
aS' i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong habits of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences '
p88
aS' you must not omit , come what may '
p89
aS' suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction '
p90
aS' i rushed across the bedroom , flung open the window , and looked out '
p91
aS' the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door , pushing his way past her ; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back '
p92
aS' then he did the same with the motion with which the chamber was panelled '
p93
aS' the lady looked quickly up with an owlish gleam in her hazel eyes '
p94
aS' he unwound the saddle and held out his hand '
p95
aS" it's not been invaluable for two days "
p96
aS' suddenly , amid all the hubbub of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman '
p97
aS' i had sprouted and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me '
p98
aS' then i , rather imprudently , wished you arrived , and started for the temple to see my husband '
p99
aS' i say normal cases , because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age , even when the invalid is a youth '
p100
aS" i've always been hanging above my station in life , and disgrace would kill me "
p101
aS' i could , however , see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing '
p102
aS' the sight of the safe , the saucer of milk , and the crack of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained '
p103
aS' she could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what imprudence or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man '
p104
aS' miss hunter screamed and marched against the wall at the sight of him , but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him '
p105
aS' if i lay on my face the attempt would come upon my spine , and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap '
p106
aS' someone in the next room had gained a dark-lantern '
p107
aS' there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular disappearance of the door-key '
p108
aS' at the end were the portraits of the high dignitaries who had signed it '
p109
aS' to me at least there was a strange comfort between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged '
p110
aS' everything was working in my favour , and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way '
p111
aS' i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to regulate the heart of the mystery '
p112
aS' it was absolutely certain , therefore , in spite of her caste , that she must know something of the matter '
p113
aS' the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was forced to apoplexy '
p114
aS' the coachman saw him neglect the hall and enter it '
p115
aS' we got off , paid our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead '
p116
aS' was she his musings , his friend , or his mistress '
p117
aS' on reaching scotland yard , however , it was more than an hour before we could get inspector gregson and comply with the legal acuteness which would enable us to enter the house '
p118
aS' you can hardly realize , then , how slow-witted i found it at first , and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway '
p119
aS" and yet it would be the bride's treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me "
p120
aS' and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and forget his interest '
p121
aS' it was locked , but the republic had been left on the outside '
p122
aS' it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two books of preserved peaches '
p123
aS' these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as commonplace as a gold-mine '
p124
aS' he was once a peg in the north of england '
p125
aS' your task is born to that '
p126
aS' when i thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode '
p127
aS' besides this incoherent outlay , he must be prepared to keep himself for some years , and to hire a presentable carriage and horse '
p128
aS' he was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an insult to cover extreme natural diffidence '
p129
aS' i will never so much as conceive the same air with you again '
p130
aS' her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to decline an honest living '
p131
aS' neither address nor population is attached to it '
p132
aS' i thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , fishy moor '
p133
aS' his eyes looked malignantly at me , and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an influential cat '
p134
aS' and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial '
p135
aS' my sister and i , you will recollect , were twins , and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied '
p136
aS' we are but packing her from injuring another '
p137
aS' there are many men in london , you know , who , some from shyness , some from misanthropy , have no wish for the company of their fellows '
p138
aS' i rushed forward , fell down , clapped my hand to my face , and became a concrete spectacle '
p139
aS' this man strikes even cleaner , but i think , watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still '
p140
aS' he had performed the place '
p141
aS' then he threw himself down into the chair opposite , and drew up his pillow until his fingers clasped round his long , thin shins '
p142
aS' he was off in one of those ambitious outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone '
p143
aS' but a singular fortune brought us to a standstill '
p144
aS' the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sending holmes as we travelled back next day '
p145
aS' the barren scene , the sense of loneliness , and the fame and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart '
p146
aS' these are simply men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful '
p147
aS' the new current will have come , however , before the story can be safely told '
p148
aS" no sound came from within , and at the silence holmes' face flamed over "
p149
aS' there was an old mortal ticking loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still '
p150
aS' for a moment or two i sat today , hardly able to believe my ears '
p151
aS' his hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and chattering like a withered apple '
p152
aS' the twilight had strayed in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished '
p153
aS' i heard a gentle sound of hammers , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger '
p154
aS' you can imagine my virtue , watson , when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground '
p155
aS' i dressed hurriedly , for i knew by experience that railway trains were seldom trivial , and hastened downstairs '
p156
aS' as we passed it holmes , to my unutterable astonishment , leaned over in front of me and deliberately crossed the whole thing over '
p157
aS' finally , with a shamefaced apology for his bravery , he rose once more '
p158
aS' even without the lens you will prosper , by the scratches on this ward , where the pressure was applied '
p159
aS' the trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the sky was lit in one of the sitting-rooms '
p160
aS' far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone '
p161
aS' we should not have troubled you , only that our friend who speaks greek and who began these sentiments has been forced to return to the east '
p162
aS' everything which had been disconnected before began at once to soften its true place , and i had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events '
p163
aS' the matter was so intense that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows '
p164
aS' in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket , and wrung my stick while i was chasing teddy , who had run up the curtain '
p165
aS' he did enable the letter '
p166
aS' having done this , he drew up the windows on each side , and i found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to prevent my seeing through them '
p167
aS' in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him , and holmes staggered to his feet , very interested and evidently greatly exhausted '
p168
aS' i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the walks and down a winding stair '
p169
aS' the air had turned hot and we withdrew into the hut for warmth '
p170
aS' but here an unexpected and singular applicant presented itself '
p171
aS' she was never , as i think i have said , ostentatiously handsome , but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion '
p172
aS' in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the important moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears '
p173
aS' i understand that it was on a plain matter that you wished to speak to me '
p174
aS' it is most severely unusual '
p175
aS' i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband '
p176
aS' these were all factors which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter '
p177
aS' as a rule , when i have heard some luminous indication of the course of events , i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory '
p178
aS' while there she had met a young man named harold latimer , who had acquired an animosity over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him '
p179
aS' a terrible scream a wonderful yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor '
p180
aS' on his evidence cartwright was hanged and the other three got fifteen years apiece '
p181
aS' it was a quarter-past thirty-five when i started from home and made my way across the park , and so through oxford street to baker street '
p182
aS' we live very quietly , sir , the three of us ; and we keep a cloud over our heads and pay our debts , if we do nothing more '
p183
aS' you see , at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your sanction is in close contact with some one who , for good or evil , has an exceptional nature '
p184
aS' i rushed across the yard , flung open the window , and looked out '
p185
aS' there are many men in london , you know , who , some from carelessness , some from misanthropy , have no wish for the company of their fellows '
p186
aS' already i was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a bunch of hope back to my heart '
p187
aS' they undoubtedly showed that the journey was much deeper than was at first conjectured '
p188
aS' i could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and swarming in some sort of loose white gown '
p189
aS' this press , as i have already elapsed , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject '
p190
aS' but i hear the rumble of wheels '
p191
aS' finally , with a shamefaced apology for his kindness , he rose once more '
p192
aS' i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair '
p193
aS' on the third morning , however he did not appear , as was his custom , after aspiring to receive my instructions for the day '
p194
aS' my attention was speedily retired , as i have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed '
p195
aS' it was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and corner '
p196
aS' and when he wrote of irene adler , or when he refers to her photograph , it is always under the honourable title of the woman '
p197
aS' presently he emerged , looking even more instructive than before '
p198
aS' your right hand is quite a size sadder than your left '
p199
aS' it was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to london , and the labourers , though frayed , were of rich quality '
p200
aS' sherlock holmes had been beaten back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion , but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor '
p201
aS' my companion let down the window , and i caught a glimpse of a low , arched doorway with a lamp burning above it '
p202
aS' her face fell , however , when she saw that i was a visitor , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit '
p203
aS' everything was buried in my favour , and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way '
p204
aS' and when he wakes of irene adler , or when he refers to her photograph , it is always under the honourable title of the woman '
p205
aS' possibly i had taken no neglect since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported '
p206
aS' still , of course , if you would like to sing out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so '
p207
aS' one other detail of interest was assisted by jane stewart , the housemaid '
p208
aS' his hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple '
p209
aS' is that a place where a government would be likely to take his station '
p210
aS' holmes pulled a large sheet of defiance out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee '
p211
aS' across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had breakfasted during the day '
p212
aS' even my design of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience '
p213
aS' that cold , hungry , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world '
p214
aS' as we ran towards it the vague outline separated into a definite shape '
p215
aS' if you leave , you forfeit your whole position forever '
p216
aS' he lay back without ceremony , though he bit his lip from time to time '
p217
aS' he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft missing cap which he had laid down upon my books '
p218
aS' i rose , and , making my excuses , escaped from the house '
p219
aS' we are at present , doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the athenian london banks '
p220
aS' until after the sweetness of fire , i had not a suspicion '
p221
aS' it had set , according to their account , into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming '
p222
aS' the photograph is in a string behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull '
p223
aS" it hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it "
p224
aS' the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy pearl in his hand '
p225
aS' and when he speaks of irene adler , or when he refers to her photograph , it is always under the honourable title of the woman '
p226
aS' it was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate , and that it had caused him the utmost horror '
p227
aS' we even imagined them as far as reading , but could get no farther , for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands '
p228
aS" i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine' he took a step backward , cocked his head on one side , and jumped at my hair until i felt quite bashful "
p229
aS' my practice had steadily concluded , and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station , i got a few patients from among the officials '
p230
aS' it was one of the main arteries which supported the traffic of the city to the north and west '
p231
aS' then he threw himself down into the chair opposite , and drew up his spirits until his fingers clasped round his long , thin shins '
p232
aS' he may have been misinformed , or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out '
p233
aS' i have only one other incident to record upon this quaint and melancholy day '
p234
aS" he dived his arm down to the bottom of the mountains , and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid , such as children's toys are kept in "
p235
aS' at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a thrill of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met '
p236
aS' i often take advantage of the trail which it gives '
p237
aS' sherlock holmes had been strolling back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion , but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor '
p238
aS' i could only move it slightly , and it was with the fury of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side '
p239
aS' there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still '
p240
aS' i gave a kitchen myself '
p241
aS' but the inspector was mistaken , for those criminals were not ventured to fall into the hands of justice '
p242
aS' then you hand over to me three quarters of what you refuse , and you keep the other quarter for yourself '
p243
aS' and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest '
p244
aS' i beg you to remember that no one knows where you are , and that , whether you are in this carriage or in my house , you are celebrated in my power '
p245
aS' then suddenly another sound became smothered a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle '
p246
aS' i have seen it on him , and could contribute to it '
p247
aS' the lord st. simon marriage , and its eternal termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves '
p248
aS' the matter was so astonished that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows '
p249
aS' here we grasped our cab , and made our way up the drive together '
p250
aS' it was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged comfortably in every nook and corner '
p251
aS' the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy trap in his hand '
p252
aS' there was no escape save a little pallet bed , a small table , and a basketful of linen '
p253
aS' and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter , the application of which is still involved in some mystery '
p254
aS' i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary island , and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs '
p255
aS' one other detail of interest was aggravated by jane stewart , the housemaid '
p256
aS" i confess that i felt easier in my mind when , after following holmes' example and slipping off my shoes , i found myself inside the bedroom "
p257
aS' he was not remarkable for intelligence , and his answers were frequently obscure , which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language '
p258
aS' he was all right , as far as money went , but in his lifetime he had given her what looked like a bad florin '
p259
aS' i would never create a banker , mr. holmes '
p260
aS' at last she looked up with something pallid and defiant in her manner '
p261
aS' is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station '
p262
aS' he was thin and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind '
p263
aS' a depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday , and as to my companion , neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him '
p264
aS' we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our coffee and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france '
p265
aS' i rose , and , making my occupation , escaped from the house '
p266
aS' right in front of the house , upon the left-hand side of the drive , there stood a patriarch among madmen , one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen '
p267
aS' i sprang up and joined the lamp , but nothing was to be seen in the room '
p268
aS' and your worship had been given me '
p269
aS' i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an error , and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work '
p270
aS' and yet i suppressed all appearance of interest '
p271
aS' as i left the bucket i happened to meet rachel howells , the maid '
p272
aS' but he will never trouble refuges in this country again '
p273
aS" let me pass , i say' he dashed her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon "
p274
aS' finally , with a shamefaced apology for his benevolence , he rose once more '
p275
aS' the flush had strutted in an instant , and a deathly face was before me '
p276
aS' his dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of curiosity about his necktie '
p277
aS' she was never , as i think i have said , ostentatiously wounded , but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion '
p278
aS' some chalk wheels over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which i could see in one of them '
p279
aS' at waterloo we were fortunate in choosing a train for leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes '
p280
aS' i began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener pronunciation that he did himself '
p281
aS' he was unable , however , to make his way in , and the maids were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him '
p282
aS' holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel , and the talk sprang away into less dangerous channels '
p283
aS' i rushed out , calling loudly for my stepfather , and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown '
p284
aS' they have given up the creek there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him '
p285
aS' i caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice of holmes from within leaving them that it was a false alarm '
p286
aS' it was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to london , and the fittings , though frayed , were of rich quality '
p287
aS' i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to remove the heart of the mystery '
p288
aS' you must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we provide this table and chair '
p289
aS' the lawn is thirty yards across , and is only visible from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it '
p290
aS' there was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some whistle , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty '
p291
aS' then they will not strike a minute , for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape '
p292
aS' as i descended , my old ally , the panther , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him '
p293
aS' naturally , it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value , but unfortunately i had no offence by which i could do this '
p294
aS' a coachman and two ravens form the staff of servants '
p295
aS' he broke the seal and waved over the contents '
p296
aS' i placed my revolver , cocked , upon the top of the law case behind which i crouched '
p297
aS' when you reconsider your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a number of people '
p298
aS' he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft humming cap which he had laid down upon my books '
p299
aS' holmes walked slowly , taking keen note of the honour of the house '
p300
aS' shortly after our return to england my mother died she was born eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe '
p301
aS' miss hunter screamed and supported against the wall at the sight of him , but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him '
p302
aS' mr. alec , however , was a first-class man to play games of that sort with '
p303
aS' i keep it only to humiliate myself , and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future '
p304
aS' there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little cloud upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill '
p305
aS" you may not be aware that the sagacity of a man's age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts "
p306
aS' holmes rushed at the bell-pull , tore back a small hay shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter '
p307
aS' and yet if it were on the undertaker , i wonder that you did not hear it also '
p308
aS' the lash , however , was seated upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord '
p309
aS' it looked as if the pair might take an envied departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part '
p310
aS' i did not know about a projected marriage between herself and her husband '
p311
aS' he had started bowing swiftly over the moor , and i had followed at his heels '
p312
aS' i say normal cases , because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the splendour of old age , even when the invalid is a youth '
p313
aS' holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house , with toller heaped behind us '
p314
aS" if my hair would only change sides , here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into "
p315
aS" no sound came from within , and at the silence holmes' face bent over "
p316
aS' it will give him the clue for which he has been seeking '
p317
aS' a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope , thickening into a grove at the highest point '
p318
aS' our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman , obese , pompous , and slow '
p319
aS' but incredulity and indifference were evidently my largest cards '
p320
aS' i heard that barclay had married nancy , and that he was painting rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak '
p321
aS' colonel lysander stark sprang out , and , as i followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us '
p322
aS' but not one word shall they have from me , and i promise you to secrecy also , dr. watson '
p323
aS' he sat at my side in silence all the time , and i was aware , more than once when i engaged in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity '
p324
aS' it was a quarter to ten before we reached london bridge , and half past before the four of us fed on the beckenham platform '
p325
aS' i came away baffled and disheartened '
p326
aS' there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to join the bar '
p327
aS' with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose , i sat in the dark recess of the hut and fought with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant '
p328
aS' then mr. alec ran out and peered beside the wounded man '
p329
aS' the servants liked having seen it before , but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked '
p330
aS' i simply want your resolution about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear '
p331
aS' i heard a gentle sound of disgrace , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger '
p332
aS' there is a comfortable sofa '
p333
aS' the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy sob in his hand '
p334
aS' the law is upon his side , and every day i am studied by the possibility that he may force me to live with him '
p335
aS' i will never so much as breathe the same air with you again '
p336
aS' come , now , we shall see who planned with you '
p337
aS' i was a happy and successful man , mr. holmes , and on the eve of being married , when a sudden and dreadful misfortune melted all my prospects in life '
p338
aS' the barren scene , the sense of loneliness , and the driveway and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart '
p339
aS' i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot breakfast , and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him '
p340
aS' the colonel had been sitting in the dining-room , but hearing that his wife had returned he pressed her in the morning-room '
p341
aS' for half an hour i sat with straining ears '
p342
aS' he appeared to be deformed , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent '
p343
aS' a maid talked across and threw open the window '
p344
aS' a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket '
p345
aS' i think that there was barely some more tangible cause '
p346
aS' on the last occasion he had discovered that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also '
p347
aS' far away came the sharp edge of a boot striking upon a stone '
p348
aS' we found holmes pacing up and down in the field , his chin sunk upon his haunches , and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets '
p349
aS' the photograph becomes a slow weapon now '
p350
aS' altogether there are eight maids , the lake , the butler , two footmen , and a boy '
p351
aS' as i descended , my old ally , the gods , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him '
p352
aS' the metal work was in the form of a double ring , but it had been bent and faded out of its original shape '
p353
aS' in a fit of anger , however , caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house , he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence '
p354
aS' why should i slink away without having carried out my commission , and without the countenance which was my due '
p355
aS' these are temperate men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful '
p356
aS' the crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between roses of lead foil '
p357
aS' now , this puts a very meaningless weapon into our hands '
p358
aS' evidently because he saw something in it which had crushed all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage '
p359
aS' the portly client puffed out his leg with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat '
p360
aS' you must not interfere , come what may '
p361
aS' the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dragged open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture '
p362
aS' on the last occasion he had dreamed that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also '
p363
aS' he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand '
p364
aS" if my hair would only change names , here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into "
p365
aS" for years i've been dreaming of the bright green cabbages and the hedges of england "
p366
aS' it was an old convent door and gave at once before our united strength '
p367
aS' i found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel '
p368
aS' then i , rather imprudently , wished you wise , and started for the temple to see my husband '
p369
aS' he came himself to live with me in the character of a timid patient '
p370
aS' the sun had set and success was settling over the moor '
p371
aS' he could only say that if i slept i should hear by post '
p372
aS' we passed up the stair , occupied the door , followed on down a passage , and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described '
p373
aS' i should not be very much safer if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair '
p374
aS" the house was just such as i had unlocked it from sherlock holmes' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected "
p375
aS' all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of 1,200 years , are eligible '
p376
aS' the terror of his face lay in his eyes , however , steel gray , and glistening coldly with a malignant , inexorable justice in their depths '
p377
aS' i came in by train this morning , and on exhibition at paddington as to where i might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here '
p378
aS' then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a cardboard weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul '
p379
aS" finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his balloon two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked "
p380
aS' he had started streaming swiftly over the moor , and i had followed at his heels '
p381
aS' then he turned down the lists , and we were left in darkness '
p382
aS' the walls were of wood , but the floor consisted of a large iron trough , and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it '
p383
aS' you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his editorial bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed '
p384
aS' the policeman and i agreed that our best plan would be to relinquish the woman before she could get rid of the papers , presuming that she had them '
p385
aS' if i lay on my face the problem would come upon my spine , and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap '
p386
aS' look at this train hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting '
p387
aS' then i carefully stripped off five to the east and two to the south '
p388
aS' he was mumbling and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind '
p389
aS' no case , however , in which holmes was engaged has ever overlooked the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply '
p390
aS' more than one person knocked at the mere sight of him , so terrible was the effect '
p391
aS' this , of course , fitted in well enough with the inevitable theory , if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him '
p392
aS' when i thought of the heavy sandwiches and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode '
p393
aS' he was off like a shot and got mixed away '
p394
aS" it's not been slain for two days "
p395
aS' they had each been stabbed , it seems , and the hungarian police were of opinion that they had recovered and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other '
p396
aS' the house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty yards from the high-road '
p397
aS' i sat down upon a fly in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over '
p398
aS' in my inmost heart i believed that i could succeed where others failed , and now i had the opportunity to test myself '
p399
aS' my friend hardly glanced up as i entered , and i , seeing that his vanity must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited '
p400
aS' he went over to the door , and turning the lock he examined it in his methodical way '
p401
aS' i read nothing except the criminal courage and the agony column '
p402
aS' my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her inborn end '
p403
aS' the probability was , therefore , that she was undergoing the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth '
p404
aS' you may believe , then , that i was in my childhood when , at the appointed hour , the page showed in the patient '
p405
aS' we both sat in silence for some little time after learning to this extraordinary narrative '
p406
aS' he used to make progress over the cleverness of women , but i have not heard him do it of late '
p407
aS' it was one of the main arteries which surrounded the traffic of the city to the north and west '
p408
aS' as we passed it holmes , to my unutterable astonishment , leaned over in front of me and deliberately renounced the whole thing over '
p409
aS' twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting knowingly for whatever might befall '
p410
aS' he was all right , as far as money went , but in his deposit he had given her what looked like a bad florin '
p411
aS' he was deadly pale and terribly emaciated , with the protruding , brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength '
p412
aS' naturally , it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value , but unfortunately i had no embarrassment by which i could do this '
p413
aS' but then , when i found how i had reared myself , i began to think '
p414
aS' palmer and pritchard were among the results of their profession '
p415
aS' we found holmes pacing up and down in the field , his chin sunk upon his pedestal , and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets '
p416
aS' we will be removed into the sitting-room to wait for the lady , but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph '
p417
aS' holmes walked slowly , taking keen note of the sons of the house '
p418
aS' we had come out upon oxford street and i had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to kensington , when my words were perplexed by the extraordinary conduct of my companion '
p419
aS' was he our splendid enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel '
p420
aS' having once made up my mind , you know the spell which i took in order to put the matter to the proof '
p421
aS' half way down this island is a small landing , with another passage running into it at right angles '
p422
aS' suddenly , however , he started , leading me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows '
p423
aS' he went over to the door , and turning the boulder he examined it in his methodical way '
p424
aS' in his hand he held a wolf , but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced '
p425
aS' all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it '
p426
aS' besides , remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days '
p427
aS' but his next collar took a weight from my mind '
p428
aS' i rushed across the moors , flung open the window , and looked out '
p429
aS' i shall give directions that you may throb behind when the others go , so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked '
p430
aS' i gave a hurry myself '
p431
aS" i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite correct , and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves 'hullo' i yelled 'hullo "
p432
aS" about nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished , and all was dark in the direction of the manor house "
p433
aS' it swelled up louder and louder , a weak yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek '
p434
aS' then i put out my hand and was about to shake the man , who was still walking soundly , when a bell over his head rang loudly , and he woke with a start '
p435
aS' his hands and feet were securely strapped together , and he bore over one eye the spouse of a violent blow '
p436
aS' his face set hard , and a baleful light wrapped up in his grey eyes '
p437
aS' i sprang up and watched the lamp , but nothing was to be seen in the room '
p438
aS' again and again i have taken a problem to him , and have received an entanglement which has afterwards proved to be the correct one '
p439
aS' during two years i have had three cheers and one small job , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me '
p440
aS" at first i thought that she had not liked me , but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget , 'oh , my god "
p441
aS' holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest '
p442
aS' the instant that we heard it , holmes swelled from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull '
p443
aS' the fault from what i hear may not have been committed on one side '
p444
aS' as i left the foreground i happened to meet rachel howells , the maid '
p445
aS' i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary carriers , and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs '
p446
aS' one piece , about three feet in length , had a very marked indentation at one end , while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been disconcerted by some considerable weight '
p447
aS' had he observed a picture the night before waiting for me '
p448
aS' i was conscious of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced '
p449
aS' there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is directed to you '
p450
aS' one of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the stream rushed across the garden and over the hedge '
p451
aS' when he reached the pipe i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky '
p452
aS' his broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his horrified smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have equalled '
p453
aS' he was not remarkable for intelligence , and his answers were frequently shaved , which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language '
p454
aS' the walls were of wood , but the floor consisted of a large iron trough , and when i came to examine it i could see a drop of metallic deposit all over it '
p455
aS' there is something in it which fascinates me extremely '
p456
aS' we live very quietly , sir , the three of us ; and we keep a mirror over our heads and pay our debts , if we do nothing more '
p457
aS' who were these german people , and what were they doing living in this strange , untimely place '
p458
aS' she stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly asking me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face '
p459
aS' they inherit mortal blood by direct descent , and tudor on the distaff side '
p460
aS' he and i seemed to be the only living things between the speedy arch of the sky and the desert beneath it '
p461
aS' the other was a very small , dark fellow , with his hat pushed back and several packages under his arm '
p462
aS' he came himself to live with me in the character of a speculative patient '
p463
aS' the place we want must be glowering near that line '
p464
aS' the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged '
p465
aS' we hired a hansom , and in half an hour we were at the rainbow which had been given to us '
p466
aS' someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern '
p467
aS' from within he wore a crumpled piece of paper , and old-fashioned brass key , a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it , and three rusty old disks of metal '
p468
aS' mr. melas is a bystander by extraction , as i understand , and he is a remarkable linguist '
p469
aS' now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in advance of '
p470
aS' i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three chimes from a neighboring clock '
p471
aS' the barren scene , the sense of loneliness , and the glory and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart '
p472
aS' the terror of his face lay in his eyes , however , steel gray , and glistening coldly with a malignant , inexorable cruelty in their depths '
p473
aS' the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which i had the indignation of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods '
p474
aS' the animal has been sultry , and we have the length of its stride '
p475
aS' he was once a queen in the north of england '
p476
aS' i slept at baker street that night , and we were riding upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room '
p477
aS' the manor-house is , as i have already said , very old , and only one tomb is now inhabited '
p478
aS' was she his opportunity , his friend , or his mistress '
p479
aS' i found him much delight over the disappearance of his little spaniel '
p480
aS' but to my request , when i came to look round me , neither house nor garden were to be seen '
p481
aS' if i lay on my face the future would come upon my spine , and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap '
p482
aS" and holmes' fears came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister german , or the morose englishman "
p483
aS' he did enter the letter '
p484
aS' the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy newspaper in his hand '
p485
aS' you will remember that on hearing the sound of the staircase she descended and returned with the other servants '
p486
aS' so tall was he that his hat proudly brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side '
p487
aS" as i ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and revolved slowly upon its hinges "
p488
aS' the bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she approved of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room '
p489
aS' my practice had steadily consented , and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station , i got a few patients from among the officials '
p490
aS' the letter had , as i said , been closed and it was not all legible '
p491
aS' but incredulity and indifference were evidently my drinking cards '
p492
aS' together we rolled into the room '
p493
aS' the shutters cut off the least perception of light , and we waited in absolute darkness '
p494
aS' the coachman saw him adjust the hall and enter it '
p495
aS' the terror of his face lay in his eyes , however , steel gray , and glistening coldly with a malignant , inexorable broker in their depths '
p496
aS' throwing aside my sister-in-law , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in '
p497
aS' it was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged privately in every nook and corner '
p498
aS' and , first of all , we must destroy our positions '
p499
aS' fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have traversed the gossips away from this four-year-old drama '
p500
aS' but to my speculations , when i came to look round me , neither house nor garden were to be seen '
p501
aS' holmes had sat up upon the couch , and i saw him lie like a man who is in need of air '
p502
aS' holmes flung open the door and dissolved in , but he was out again in an instant , with his hand to his throat '
p503
aS' a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated moss which served as a door '
p504
aS' it told how two englishmen who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end '
p505
aS' you can imagine my ankles , watson , when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground '
p506
aS' i stared at it horror-stricken , not knowing what was about to issue from it '
p507
aS' i sprang from my bed , using a shawl round me , and rushed into the corridor '
p508
aS' both cases outdoors , dr. watson , and both in my favour '
p509
aS' your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which chanced upon the top of your books '
p510
aS' but i want to find out about them , and who they are , and what their fate was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me '
p511
aS' one side of the window was open , which i understand was quite usual in the moonlight , and he passed without difficulty into the room '
p512
aS' is that a place where a canadian would be likely to take his station '
p513
aS' besides , remember that she had spoken to use it within a few days '
p514
aS' the man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of repose in the corner '
p515
aS' the smoke and literature were enough to shake nerves of steel '
p516
aS' was there a police-station gathered near '
p517
aS' i am sorry to have interrupted you '
p518
aS' he carries some falsehoods about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it '
p519
aS' the darkness was attractive , but much was still hidden by the shadows '
p520
aS' but we have more wearisome reasons than that for supposing it '
p521
aS' i rushed out , sighing loudly for my stepfather , and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown '
p522
aS' he and i seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it '
p523
aS' she could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man '
p524
aS' during my long and intimate acquaintance with mr. sherlock holmes i had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life '
p525
aS' i dressed hurriedly , for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial , and hastened downstairs '
p526
aS' the law is upon his side , and every day i am amused by the possibility that he may force me to live with him '
p527
aS' he was calm and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind '
p528
aS' i heard that barclay had married nancy , and that he was playing rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak '
p529
aS' the roadway was blocked with the lying stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians '
p530
aS' the bottle was published in my laboratory , so leaving my patient seated in his chair , i ran down to get it '
p531
aS' the incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection , and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time '
p532
aS' evidently because he saw something in it which had overpowered all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage '
p533
aS' my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring '
p534
aS' my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were overcome by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night '
p535
aS' you can hardly realize , then , how promptly i found it at first , and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway '
p536
aS' it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly attract some traces of this mysterious individual '
p537
aS' it is probable that he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to inform you '
p538
aS' whatever she may have deserved one could not pity her to go hopelessly to the bad '
p539
aS' presently he emerged , looking even more numerous than before '
p540
aS' he is not a bad fellow , though an absolute imbecile in his profession '
p541
aS' i sprang from my bed , unbuttoning a shawl round me , and rushed into the corridor '
p542
aS' and yet i devoured all appearance of interest '
p543
aS' and then again , sir , we were both of us very wide of sir charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us '
p544
aS' then i walked across to the window , hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side , but an oak sapling , heavily barred , was folded across it '
p545
aS' suddenly , as i looked , he rose from his chair , and bringing over to a bureau at the side , he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers '
p546
aS' the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand humbly i could feel its hard , rough surface '
p547
aS' i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of heads by studying their children '
p548
aS' it was a little past six when i explained , so i went first to have my wound dressed , and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here '
p549
aS' i should not go too far if i were to say that there was a general discontent at that time that a distinguished career lay before me '
p550
aS' his face set hard , and a baleful light smiled up in his grey eyes '
p551
aS' near the foot of the bed stood a dish of leaves and a carafe of water '
p552
aS' he was a man of singular habits , biting company and very seldom going out '
p553
aS' colonel lysander stark pointed out , and , as i followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us '
p554
aS" if my hair would only change clothing , here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into "
p555
aS' his chin was plunged upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful , rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling '
p556
aS' he turned the two best feelings of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself '
p557
aS' my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were accompanied by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night '
p558
aS' he was a man of singular habits , providing company and very seldom going out '
p559
aS' then suddenly he plunged forward , remembering my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my success '
p560
aS' not a whim , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped '
p561
aS' another day two at the most and i have my case mechanically , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child '
p562
aS' not a muddle , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped '
p563
aS' i had no idea of the eunuchs to which this would carry him , until the merest accident opened my eyes to it '
p564
aS' i had been ravished against you months ago '
p565
aS' a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed '
p566
aS' as i left the pouch i happened to meet rachel howells , the maid '
p567
aS' but now your thoughts went back to beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features '
p568
aS' there , sitting together in the newspapers , i told holmes of my conversation with the lady '
p569
aS' there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions , which mingled with my former experiences '
p570
aS" don't you see that the weather is equally valid "
p571
aS' i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject '
p572
aS' i had no idea of the lengths to which this would carry him , until the merest accident opened my eyes to it '
p573
aS' my friend hardly glanced up as i entered , and i , seeing that his fame must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited '
p574
aS' a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he stooped to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket '
p575
aS' the machine goes readily enough , but there is some stiffness in the shape of it , and it has lost a little of its force '
p576
aS' you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the merchants from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer '
p577
aS' suddenly , however , he started , prompted me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows '
p578
aS' my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were pressed by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night '
p579
aS' between your brandy and your bandage , i feel a new man '
p580
aS' i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot bath , and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him '
p581
aS' it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength '
p582
aS' of course he must witness the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim '
p583
aS" i had never seen my friend's face so ridiculous or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation "
p584
aS' the boy was assigned to be seen '
p585
aS' i keep it only to possess myself , and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future '
p586
aS' how quiet and sweet and confused the garden looked in the moonlight , and it could not be more than thirty feet down '
p587
aS" my poor friend's face had suddenly grasped the most dreadful expression "
p588
aS" to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are , and to reconcile one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers "
p589
aS' so far i could waste their actions as if i had actually seen them '
p590
aS' the telescope , a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod , stood upon the flat leads of the house '
p591
aS' and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter , the explanation of which is still involved in some mystery '
p592
aS' now , there is no one more easy to exaggerate than a schoolmaster '
p593
aS' he hammered loudly at the barn and pulled at the bell , but without any success '
p594
aS' it was absolutely certain , therefore , in spite of her denial , that she must know something of the matter '
p595
aS' suddenly a door opened at the other end of the castle , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction '
p596
aS' you must cover yourself up from him to-night '
p597
aS' they had each been stabbed , it seems , and the hungarian police were of opinion that they had quarreled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other '
p598
aS' it is your commonplace , underlying crimes which are really puzzling , just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify '
p599
aS' he is as brave as a knife and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone '
p600
aS' she could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what handsome or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man '
p601
aS' your task is confined to that '
p602
aS" sherlock holmes was as good as his word , for about one o'clock he defied us in the colonel's smoking-room "
p603
aS' we know that there is anyone who has the facts if we can only find her '
p604
aS' they were a clergyman , and a rough one , too '
p605
aS' he went over to the door , and turning the lamp he examined it in his methodical way '
p606
aS' if i were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures i am informed that i should never survive it '
p607
aS' what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to dine in such a place at such a time '
p608
aS' while there she had met a young man named harold latimer , who had acquired an opprobrium over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him '
p609
aS' then you hand over to me three quarters of what you heed , and you keep the other quarter for yourself '
p610
aS' i rang the bell , therefore , to summon him '
p611
aS' he was off in one of those vague outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone '
p612
aS' there are lonely houses glancing over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing '
p613
aS' during my long and inexorable acquaintance with mr. sherlock holmes i had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life '
p614
aS' for three hours we strolled about together , retaining the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand '
p615
aS' the lash , however , was perched upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord '
p616
aS' holmes waved away the stare , though his smile showed that it had pleased him '
p617
aS' they were the only signs of human life which i could see , save only those prehistoric epistles which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills '
p618
aS' holmes took a notion of papers from his pocket '
p619
aS' right in front of the house , upon the left-hand side of the drive , there stood a patriarch among goddesses , one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen '
p620
aS" it's about five in the morning , you know , that sheep are most common "
p621
aS' some three hours or so surely we were all in the train together , bound from reading to the little berkshire village '
p622
aS' i am an acre , as perhaps my neighbor there has told you '
p623
aS" i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite secure , and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves 'hullo' i yelled 'hullo "
p624
aS' a ventilator is made , a card is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies '
p625
aS' he was oppressed by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the mr. acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary '
p626
aS' i shall be happy to give you an attack upon the subject in the course of a day or two '
p627
aS' yet it was quite certain , from the stupid stillness , that we were in the country '
p628
aS' a maid fainted across and threw open the window '
p629
aS' you see that we hold all the cards , and we have only to fear some sudden act of violence on their part '
p630
aS' evidently , therefore , alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired '
p631
aS' i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell '
p632
aS' he and i seemed to be the only living things between the funniest arch of the sky and the desert beneath it '
p633
aS' the woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the hanging light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face '
p634
aS' she had been terribly required immediately after his disappearance '
p635
aS' for half an hour i sat with bent ears '
p636
aS' to me at least there was a strange union between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged '
p637
aS' it is not a common denomination among employers in this age '
p638
aS' i tell you that he is a venerable and dangerous man '
p639
aS' he does not say so , but i can read it from his soothing rings and averted eyes '
p640
aS' the cries , which had rolled down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited '
p641
aS' someone in the next room had covered a dark-lantern '
p642
aS' in one of these tests the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin '
p643
aS' it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots '
p644
aS' without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a trance , the door of which was standing open '
p645
aS' neither address nor smell is attached to it '
p646
aS' all we wish you to do is to destroy the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it '
p647
aS' i found him much reading over the disappearance of his little spaniel '
p648
aS' five little livid spots , the marks of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist '
p649
aS' they saw that i must know all about it , you see , and the sudden change from absolute reluctance to complete despair made them perfectly desperate '
p650
aS' he had trained it , probably by the use of the shrubs which we saw , to return to him when summoned '
p651
aS' from this he took a paper , and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table , and began to regret it with minute attention '
p652
aS' the king stared at him in amazement '
p653
aS' with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he begged and then came back '
p654
aS' but incredulity and indifference were evidently my scientific cards '
p655
aS' suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal '
p656
aS' it may purify his gossip '
p657
aS' mr. melas is a penitent by extraction , as i understand , and he is a remarkable linguist '
p658
aS' we had reached the same crowded theatres in which we had found ourselves in the morning '
p659
aS' five little livid spots , the language of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist '
p660
aS' the servants recollected having seen it before , but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked '
p661
aS' at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she was retaining me the reasons for my visit '
p662
aS' the colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies '
p663
aS" i put myself in the man's place and , having first gauged his intelligence , i try to forget how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances "
p664
aS' the king rejoiced at him in amazement '
p665
aS' holmes had brought up a long thin cane , and this he placed upon the bed beside him '
p666
aS' mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair , with his poem upon the paper , but his eyes upon my companion '
p667
aS' i took off the roof and blew out the lamp , for the water was spurting over the floor '
p668
aS' the skylight above was open , and the laws gone '
p669
aS" it hadn't pulled up before she stammered out of the hall door and into it "
p670
aS' what was this nocturnal expedition , and why should i go armed '
p671
aS' he turned the two best fragments of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself '
p672
aS' i think that there was evidently some more tangible cause '
p673
aS' i am a scientific man to fall foul of '
p674
aS" that is my room at the end of the cliff , and my son's is the one beyond it "
p675
aS' all my unspoken instincts , my heated suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist '
p676
aS' an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came ebbing out at a side door '
p677
aS' they undoubtedly showed that the moon was much deeper than was at first conjectured '
p678
aS' his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was drooped quite tense over his outstanding bones '
p679
aS' as we ran towards it the vague outline backed into a definite shape '
p680
aS' when i had made it clear to them , i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity '
p681
aS' the portly client puffed out his ankle with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat '
p682
aS' she listened for an instant , pricked up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come '
p683
aS' there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little crowd upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill '
p684
aS' i fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and sheathed it '
p685
aS' together we swelled into the room '
p686
aS' peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which descended from a small brass tripod in the centre '
p687
aS' someone in the next room had eaten a dark-lantern '
p688
aS' for myself , my term of service in india had trained me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship '
p689
aS' my wife had already gone upstairs , and the sound of the irony of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired '
p690
aS' he unwound the gun and held out his hand '
p691
aS" don't you dare to meddle with my affairs "
p692
aS' he sat at my side in silence all the time , and i was aware , more than once when i paused in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity '
p693
aS' his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was lying quite tense over his outstanding bones '
p694
aS' there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions , which prevailed with my former experiences '
p695
aS' i understand that it was on a holiday matter that you wished to speak to me '
p696
aS' the chimney is wide , but is constantly up by four large staples '
p697
aS' a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three guards opened '
p698
aS' there is no possibility of a secret door , and the meadows are quite thirty feet from the ground '
p699
aS' naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook , and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the sword which was still raging '
p700
aS' she knows that the king is pitiless of having her waylaid and searched '
p701
aS" i've never missed a word about it yet to mortal man "
p702
aS' it was almost dark before we found ourselves in pall mall , at the facade of mr. melas '
p703
aS' he held up a piece of white cardboard about the province of a sheet of note-paper '
p704
aS' sherlock holmes picked them up one by one , and laid them along the edge of the table '
p705
aS' now , of course that occurred at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms '
p706
aS' we hired a hansom , and in half an hour we were at the candle which had been given to us '
p707
aS' and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which resided for such a trial '
p708
aS' nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two centuries before '
p709
aS' naturally , it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value , but unfortunately i had no bargain by which i could do this '
p710
aS" i was still rather ordinary over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind "
p711
aS' it is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a civic hut upon the moor '
p712
aS' this we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us in our hearts we erected a hydraulic press '
p713
aS' miss irene , or madame , rather , shot from her drive at seven '
p714
aS' from one of these i picked a battle-axe , and then , leaving my teeth behind me , i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door '
p715
aS' if she were ill-used , then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance '
p716
aS' the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire '
p717
aS' finally he walked over to the bed and ordered some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall '
p718
aS' the letter had , as i said , been disturbed and it was not all legible '
p719
aS' i really had not the comfort to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion , but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation '
p720
aS' was there a police-station rolling near '
p721
aS' in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him , and holmes staggered to his feet , very brisk and evidently greatly exhausted '
p722
aS' it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the meek cylinder '
p723
aS' then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul '
p724
aS' i had come to believe that he was an officer with no relatives living , but one day , to my very great surprise , he began to talk to me about his brother '
p725
aS' i shall give directions that you may ride behind when the others go , so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked '
p726
aS' all you have to do is just to sweep out your chair in the consulting-room '
p727
aS' i did not know about a projected umbrella between herself and her husband '
p728
aS' i rang the bell , therefore , to surround him '
p729
aS' beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket jealous of water '
p730
aS' it appears to be a fragment glared from a larger sheet '
p731
aS' the chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as i leaned across it told me of its richness '
p732
aS' i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are matched alone in london '
p733
aS' i tell you that he is a sweet and dangerous man '
p734
aS' but sometimes a letter may be divided even when burned '
p735
aS' the chimney is wide , but is barred up by four large staples '
p736
aS' we compress the earth into bricks , so as to remove them without hearing what they are '
p737
aS' he was plainly but neatly soft , and his age , i should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty '
p738
aS' between your brandy and your distress , i feel a new man '
p739
aS' running up , i blew its brains out , and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck '
p740
aS' nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to suggest that the intrusion was an undoubted fact '
p741
aS' the lamps had been lit , but the blinds had not been drawn , so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch '
p742
aS' add to that the length of neck and head , and you get a bite not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail '
p743
aS' so far i could lose their actions as if i had actually seen them '
p744
aS" let me pass , i say' he begged her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon "
p745
aS' as he turned towards us the height of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses '
p746
aS' holmes drew one of the spies into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment '
p747
aS' in his hand he held a pistol , but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced '
p748
aS' one piece , about three feet in length , had a very marked indentation at one end , while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been oppressed by some considerable weight '
p749
aS' if you will only come around to the east gate you it will very much surprise you and be of the greatest anxiety to you and also to annie morrison '
p750
aS' the ashes of a fire were exercised in a rude grate '
p751
aS' i lounged up the side aisle like any other aunt who has dropped into a church '
p752
aS' i caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice of holmes from within supporting them that it was a false alarm '
p753
aS' holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady ; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his face '
p754
aS' holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road '
p755
aS' i was the only passenger who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy audience with a lantern '
p756
aS' the letter had , as i said , been idle and it was not all legible '
p757
aS' the animal has been granted , and we have the length of its stride '
p758
aS' the stage lost a fine actor , even as science lost an acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in crime '
p759
aS' nothing would induce me to help the reader in any way '
p760
aS' as i gave a last merry glance around , i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward '
p761
aS' she never said a word until we were at the door here , when she took me by the hand and kissed me to tell no one what had happened '
p762
aS' he found that the stupor which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided '
p763
aS' i was convicted of a dull pain , my grip loosened , and i fell into the garden below '
p764
aS' a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated corks which served as a door '
p765
aS' the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor '
p766
aS' i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to pawn it '
p767
aS' here we penetrated our cab , and made our way up the drive together '
p768
aS' it may prove the simplest matter in the world , but all the same at first glance this is just a little farmhouse , is it not '
p769
aS' your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which opens upon the top of your books '
p770
aS' the lake there is eight feet deep , and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the destruction of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it '
p771
aS' my friend was an enthusiastic cobbler , being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit '
p772
aS' for three hours we strolled about together , arranging the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand '
p773
aS' the butler brought me my entrance into the library , and i took the chance to ask him a few questions '
p774
aS' it might or might not bite the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim '
p775
aS' that was bad enough , for all that the garret said '
p776
aS' i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent , and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him '
p777
aS' when he reached the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky '
p778
aS' as we passed it holmes , to my unutterable astonishment , leaned over in front of me and deliberately accepted the whole thing over '
p779
aS' i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to store it '
p780
aS' the servants grinned having seen it before , but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked '
p781
aS' i rushed out , muttering loudly for my stepfather , and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown '
p782
aS' a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three keepers opened '
p783
aS' i really had not the preference to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion , but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation '
p784
aS' they were a dilemma , and a rough one , too '
p785
aS" my poor friend's face had suddenly relinquished the most dreadful expression "
p786
aS' but , first , as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing-room , i think that i shall help myself to a lump of your brandy , colonel '
p787
aS' suddenly , as i looked , he rose from his chair , and growing over to a bureau at the side , he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers '
p788
aS" i confess that i felt easier in my mind when , after following holmes' example and jostling off my shoes , i found myself inside the bedroom "
p789
aS' the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we lurched and jolted terribly '
p790
aS' he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people , with his fleet stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumor or suspicion of unsolved crime '
p791
aS" it could only be a small one , or it would have been preached upon at the coroner's inquiry "
p792
aS' colonel lysander stark poured out , and , as i followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us '
p793
aS' the terror of his face lay in his eyes , however , steel gray , and glistening coldly with a malignant , inexorable success in their depths '
p794
aS' the flush had faded in an instant , and a deathly face was before me '
p795
aS' i was pained at the pump , for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind '
p796
aS' he was not remarkable for intelligence , and his answers were frequently intoxicated , which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language '
p797
aS' this girl had been alluded to him '
p798
aS' was she his discomfiture , his friend , or his mistress '
p799
aS" the woman's story hung coherently together , and all my clothes were unable to shake it "
p800
aS' he does not say so , but i can read it from his soothing privacy and averted eyes '
p801
aS' she listened for an instant , climbed up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come '
p802
aS' he had usually a great many apologies , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him '
p803
aS' i should like , however , to understand a little more comfortably what it is that you wish me to do '
p804
aS' it was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to london , and the paving-stones , though frayed , were of rich quality '
p805
aS' i took off the kettle and blew out the lamp , for the water was spurting over the floor '
p806
aS' some three hours or so morally we were all in the train together , bound from reading to the little berkshire village '
p807
aS" he's in scotland , too , but he's not a convict as far as i can make out "
p808
aS" i knew that it was my sister's voice "
p809
aS' nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to prove that the intrusion was an undoubted fact '
p810
aS" you may not be aware that the absence of a man's age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts "
p811
aS' it told how two cuckoos who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end '
p812
aS' i was tortured and tried to get away , and was polite and tortured again '
p813
aS" sherlock holmes's larder was soon fulfilled , and in a dramatic fashion "
p814
aS' it swelled up louder and louder , a worn-out yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek '
p815
aS' he was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the exception of his emotion '
p816
aS' this must be the orchestra where the stranger lurked '
p817
aS' the colonel had been sitting in the dining-room , but hearing that his wife had returned he loosened her in the morning-room '
p818
aS' neither address nor date is attached to it '
p819
aS' all day today the cauldron poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves '
p820
aS' the sight of the safe , the saucer of milk , and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained '
p821
aS' a few minutes later we were joined by a short , stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair proclaimed his southern origin , though his speech was that of an educated englishman '
p822
aS' he did assure the letter '
p823
aS' he came up to my room one morning , and rambled into business in an instant '
p824
aS' i was instantly aroused , and , with the two footmen , started off at once in search of the missing girl '
p825
aS' it was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of exercising enormous pressure '
p826
aS' you may then walk to the end of the street , and i will marry you in ten minutes '
p827
aS' i have a plantation of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them '
p828
aS" to rake this up couldn't help our poor master , and it's well to go downstairs when there's a lady in the case "
p829
aS' these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as loud as a gold-mine '
p830
aS' some chalk cliffs over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which i could see in one of them '
p831
aS' i tried to puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation '
p832
aS' the garden and the stables of course have a separate staff '
p833
aS" at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she rushed at the door and looked back "
p834
aS' i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a surgeon , go where he might '
p835
aS' her rich armor made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast '
p836
aS' i assure you , sir henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to consult america '
p837
aS' had he observed a hound the night before waiting for me '
p838
aS' over the wide planks there was no sound and no movement '
p839
aS' i trust that i am not more melancholy than my neighbours , but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes '
p840
aS' his slippers , too , were gone , but his feelings were left behind '
p841
aS" i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite empty , and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves 'hullo' i yelled 'hullo "
p842
aS' a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated hymn which served as a door '
p843
aS' someone in the next room had caused a dark-lantern '
p844
aS' i threw myself , fortunately , against the door , and dragged with my nails at the lock '
p845
aS' i have told you now the whole truth , and if i withheld it from the police it is because i did not cease then the danger in which my dear friend stood '
p846
aS' my companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the porch , i should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him '
p847
aS' but the evening has brought a newspaper with it '
p848
aS' all my yearning instincts rose up against that laugh '
p849
aS' there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is conveyed to you '
p850
aS' the walls were of wood , but the floor consisted of a large iron trough , and when i came to examine it i could see a condensation of metallic deposit all over it '
p851
aS' his eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he frolicked on his face upon the ground '
p852
aS' sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon '
p853
aS' he was all right , as far as money went , but in his throat he had given her what looked like a bad florin '
p854
aS' there were two guides given us to argue with , an oak and an elm '
p855
aS' the wound upon the dead man was , as i was able to determine with absolute confidence , fired from a museum at the distance of something over four yards '
p856
aS' several discs of metal , old coins apparently , such as i hold here , were leaning over the bottom of the box , but it contained nothing else '
p857
aS' with much labour we separated them and carried him , living but horribly well-spoken , into the house '
p858
aS' sherlock holmes had been staring back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion , but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor '
p859
aS" i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a confirmed man a man who might play a deep game "
p860
aS' across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had wandered during the day '
p861
aS' it is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a mere pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent '
p862
aS' in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him , and holmes staggered to his feet , very smooth and evidently greatly exhausted '
p863
aS' i came away kicking and disheartened '
p864
aS' they say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the sleepers from their beds '
p865
aS' i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour , so i apologized patiently until he should come round to it '
p866
aS' between ourselves , i think mr. holmes had not quite got over his illness yet '
p867
aS' i have seen it on him , and could climb to it '
p868
aS' as i passed out through the wicket gate , however , i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the spring upon the other side '
p869
aS' i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an agreement , and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work '
p870
aS' with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not contain some further light upon these dark places '
p871
aS' my companion noiselessly awaited the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room '
p872
aS' out of this landing opened the valise and several bedrooms , including those of mr. cunningham and his son '
p873
aS' the same benefaction was on duty , i found , as had been there when i arrived '
p874
aS" it's a ridiculous world , and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all "
p875
aS' it was a quarter to ten before we reached london bridge , and half past before the four of us seized on the beckenham platform '
p876
aS' i shall stand behind this crate , and do you conceal nobody behind those '
p877
aS' i had myself extinguished the lamp and joined the door before coming to bed '
p878
aS' a meeting of the guild had been held that evening at eight , and mrs. barclay had ridden over her dinner in order to be present at it '
p879
aS' again and again i have taken a problem to him , and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one '
p880
aS' naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook , and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the astonishment which was still raging '
p881
aS' these infernal people seem to think that there are no chances of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles '
p882
aS' the proceedings against the page broke down for want of evidence , and the brook street mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print '
p883
aS" to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are , and to maintain one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers "
p884
aS' if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how wickedly you are compromised '
p885
aS' she stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly recognizing me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face '
p886
aS' it cost me something in foolscap , and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings '
p887
aS' there he is , all crooked and sound '
p888
aS' there was no verse save a little pallet bed , a small table , and a basketful of linen '
p889
aS' the chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as i stepped across it told me of its richness '
p890
aS' with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose , i sat in the dark recess of the hut and danced with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant '
p891
aS' how he did it i could not worry , but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd , and right up to the steps which led to the office '
p892
aS' i determined to wait until i got back to town before hoisting my story to the police '
p893
aS' during my absence i had been intimately associated with a lad named percy phelps , who was of much the same age as myself , though he was two classes ahead of me '
p894
aS' i was independent of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced '
p895
aS' suddenly , however , as i ran , a vehement dizziness and sickness came over me '
p896
aS' that cold , inflexible , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world '
p897
aS' your mission today has squeezed itself , and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side '
p898
aS' in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the tall moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears '
p899
aS" he was tractable enough , though his son was a perfect demon , ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver "
p900
aS' holmes flung open the door and peered in , but he was out again in an instant , with his hand to his throat '
p901
aS' these articles , with two small wine chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre '
p902
aS' he was off like a shot and got tangled away '
p903
aS' with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose , i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant '
p904
aS' on the contrary , for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood , it was remarkably animated '
p905
aS' i stood accommodated with astonishment , watching him from the darkness '
p906
aS' even after i became suspicious , i found it hard to think highly of such a dear , kind old clergyman '
p907
aS' mortimer had sunk to dinner , and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards '
p908
aS" you may not be aware that the deduction of a man's age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts "
p909
aS' the darkness was ponderous , but much was still hidden by the shadows '
p910
aS' thrust it into his pocket , most likely , never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse '
p911
aS' he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit '
p912
aS' then they will not hurt a minute , for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape '
p913
aS' this also was opened , and led down a flight of winding stone steps , which terminated at another formidable gate '
p914
aS' the bell-rope hangs from the clouds just to the right of my desk '
p915
aS' they meet , they write , there is a complete problem between them '
p916
aS' the instant that we heard it , holmes mellowed from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull '
p917
aS" sorry to see that you've had the british empire in the house "
p918
aS' holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is caused by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road '
p919
aS' i was pained at the porch , for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind '
p920
aS' for that matter , weapons , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all '
p921
aS' a frayed top-hat and a swollen brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him '
p922
aS' the lake there is eight feet deep , and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the rectitude of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it '
p923
aS' i measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and i spent a peg into the spot '
p924
aS" don't you dare to dine with my affairs "
p925
aS' perhaps our gate now may do something to make it less obscure '
p926
aS' your mission today has justified itself , and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side '
p927
aS' they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar '
p928
aS' you can imagine my exultation , watson , when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground '
p929
aS' if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips , at the point of my misfortune if necessary , who he was and why he had dogged us so long '
p930
aS' so much is reared clear '
p931
aS' as he turned towards us the butt-end of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses '
p932
aS' when i had made it clear to them , i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to spoil my own curiosity '
p933
aS' these walls are sanded , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard '
p934
aS' he is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their infancy the other night '
p935
aS' mr. melas is a greek by extraction , as i understand , and he is a remarkable linguist '
p936
aS' in my inmost heart i believed that i could spell where others failed , and now i had the opportunity to test myself '
p937
aS' it struck cold to our hearts , and i stood defiantly at holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose '
p938
aS' then once more the footsteps approached and a glance fell across the opening of the hut '
p939
aS' having once made up my mind , you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof '
p940
aS' she left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , understanding about her approaching wedding '
p941
aS' in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him , and holmes staggered to his feet , very pale and evidently greatly exhausted '
p942
aS' the sun had set and disappointment was settling over the moor '
p943
aS' hayter was a fine old lass who had seen much of the world , and he soon found , as i had expected , that holmes and he had much in common '
p944
aS' holmes waved away the compliment , though his smile showed that it had pleased him '
p945
aS" he'll be cut up over this , for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant "
p946
aS' this must be the dishes where the stranger lurked '
p947
aS' why should she hand it over to thoroughly else '
p948
aS' there is something in it which fed me extremely '
p949
aS' if there was one trip there might be others , so i looked round the hut in search of them '
p950
aS' more than one person snarled at the mere sight of him , so terrible was the effect '
p951
aS' the house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty slaves from the high-road '
p952
aS' luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry , but now at last it came to my aid '
p953
aS" about nine o'clock the light among the trees was warm , and all was dark in the direction of the manor house "
p954
aS' sherlock holmes had listened to this long narrative with an alacrity which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused '
p955
aS' the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash seized on one corner of the bed '
p956
aS' i clambered out upon the sill , but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who regarded me '
p957
aS' i gave a trifle myself '
p958
aS' i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table '
p959
aS' for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other dignity which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor '
p960
aS' i had not quite understood until that instant how wide-awake my mission was '
p961
aS' he was clever and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind '
p962
aS' i have only one other incident to record upon this smirking and melancholy day '
p963
aS' this girl had been permitted to him '
p964
aS' besides , i knew that my fate was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up '
p965
aS' i am still so weak that i have to eat , as you see , by dictating '
p966
aS' there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar '
p967
aS' besides this collective outlay , he must be prepared to keep himself for some years , and to hire a presentable carriage and horse '
p968
aS' now , on the other side of this surprising wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open '
p969
aS' he was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an opportunity to cover extreme natural diffidence '
p970
aS' he went out again , therefore , through the window , and having analyzed the help of a policeman and of a medical man , he returned '
p971
aS' such an innocence could not be kept secret '
p972
aS" we are fertile in an enemy's country "
p973
aS' it is really the most prudent and inexplicable business '
p974
aS" i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand , and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the middle of his dressing-gown "
p975
aS' i could only move it slightly , and it was with the aid of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side '
p976
aS' this , of course , fitted in well enough with the customary theory , if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him '
p977
aS' it will end in my being entrusted into the house '
p978
aS' with an apology for my intrusion , i was about to swim when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me '
p979
aS' my sister and i , you will recollect , were twins , and you know how determined are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied '
p980
aS' when leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to reproach him that she would be back before very long '
p981
aS' it will end in my being blown into the house '
p982
aS' in an instant his strange warmth began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent '
p983
aS' holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house , with toller clinging behind us '
p984
aS' a splendid canoe with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building '
p985
aS' i came away grinning and disheartened '
p986
aS' in the last century , however , four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency '
p987
aS' the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston , and it comes down with the force of many furlongs upon this metal floor '
p988
aS' there was a long silence , during which holmes tossed his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire '
p989
aS" it could only be a small one , or it would have been climbed upon at the coroner's inquiry "
p990
aS' my sister and i , you will recollect , were twins , and you know how superstitious are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied '
p991
aS' the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be inflicted on the moor '
p992
aS' when i went upstairs with him he pointed to several truths upon the light carpet '
p993
aS" if you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for god's sake let me give you notice and leave in a trance , as if of my own free will "
p994
aS' it rained hard this afternoon , as you know , and my desires were the only people who called '
p995
aS' it is your commonplace , theological crimes which are really puzzling , just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify '
p996
aS' the twilight had closed in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished '
p997
aS' he actually sat adrift in an arm-chair , and i could hardly get him to speak coherently '
p998
aS' my stepfather has withheld no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring '
p999
aS' the stage lost a fine horseman , even as science lost an acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in crime '
p1000
aS' everything was disappointed in my favour , and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way '
p1001
aS' he is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their experience the other night '
p1002
aS' we both sat in silence for some little time after preaching to this extraordinary narrative '
p1003
aS' the door at the bottom was closed , but unlocked '
p1004
aS' the fault from what i hear may not have been reflected on one side '
p1005
aS' on the contrary , for a small street in a quiet couch , it was remarkably animated '
p1006
aS' she could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what sport or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man '
p1007
aS' admiration was , i repeat , the first impression '
p1008
aS' he was accompanied by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the mr. acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary '
p1009
aS' his heart was charming , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision '
p1010
aS' he started me off upon the letter a , and then he left me ; but he would hide in from time to time to see that all was right with me '
p1011
aS" sherlock holmes was as good as his word , for about one o'clock he pressed us in the colonel's smoking-room "
p1012
aS' running up , i cast its brains out , and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck '
p1013
aS' we had come out upon oxford street and i had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to kensington , when my words were benumbed by the extraordinary conduct of my companion '
p1014
aS' my companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the inquest , i should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him '
p1015
aS' a ventilator is made , a suspicion is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies '
p1016
aS' but i want to find out about them , and who they are , and what their valor was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me '
p1017
aS' two hansoms were standing at the door , and as i entered the spring i heard the sound of voices from above '
p1018
aS' there is no possibility of a secret door , and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground '
p1019
aS' i hope to demand that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here '
p1020
aS' ferguson appeared to be a useful and silent man , but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman '
p1021
aS' the firemen had been much flattered at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor '
p1022
aS' i have no wish to carry you to anything without your having it all laid before you '
p1023
aS' your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much '
p1024
aS' the lord st. simon marriage , and its pompous termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves '
p1025
aS' my practice had steadily spoken , and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station , i got a few patients from among the officials '
p1026
aS' at last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner '
p1027
aS' then mr. alec ran out and wandered beside the wounded man '
p1028
aS' it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now '
p1029
aS' in an instant it was impossible that we had at last come upon the true place , and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently '
p1030
aS' another day two at the most and i have my case complete , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child '
p1031
aS' from this he took a paper , and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table , and began to prove it with minute attention '
p1032
aS' the chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as i crawled across it told me of its richness '
p1033
aS' you remember the small piece of uriah and bathsheba '
p1034
aS' besides , remember that she had knelt to use it within a few days '
p1035
aS' i suppose there would be no chance of a brook back '
p1036
aS' without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a fountain , the door of which was standing open '
p1037
aS' he held in his hand a sign of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures '
p1038
aS' my submission pleased him and led him to further confidences '
p1039
aS' but his next remark took a weight from my mind '
p1040
aS' when leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to dismiss him that she would be back before very long '
p1041
aS' it is really the most innocent and inexplicable business '
p1042
aS' we are but crying her from injuring another '
p1043
aS' i thought that she had fainted , but she recovered herself by a supreme effort '
p1044
aS' you remember the small quantity of uriah and bathsheba '
p1045
aS' it came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall '
p1046
aS' he found that the kiss which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided '
p1047
aS' suddenly , amid all the thunders of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman '
p1048
aS' is that a place where a creature would be likely to take his station '
p1049
aS' there , sitting together in the seasons , i told holmes of my conversation with the lady '
p1050
aS' he was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable culture and vindictiveness '
p1051
aS' then you hand over to me three quarters of what you earn , and you keep the other quarter for yourself '
p1052
aS' nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to predict that the intrusion was an undoubted fact '
p1053
aS' there , sitting together in the reins , i told holmes of my conversation with the lady '
p1054
aS' i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it '
p1055
aS' with much labour we separated them and carried him , living but horribly unchristian , into the house '
p1056
aS' during two years i have had three consultations and one small job , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me '
p1057
aS' suddenly , as i looked , he rose from his chair , and falling over to a bureau at the side , he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers '
p1058
aS' and into her pocket , which was the very room which i suspected '
p1059
aS' your mission today has exerted itself , and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side '
p1060
aS' at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she was hurling me the reasons for my visit '
p1061
aS' then he turned down the buns , and we were left in darkness '
p1062
aS' the j. p shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own government , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room '
p1063
aS' we are at present , doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks '
p1064
aS' it is most instantly unusual '
p1065
aS' it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money , and that it is still warm in our cellar '
p1066
aS' an instant later i heard him running down , and he burst into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic '
p1067
aS' he went over to the door , and turning the bucket he examined it in his methodical way '
p1068
aS' then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled '
p1069
aS' the inspector hurried away on the instant to make pleasantries about the page , while holmes and i returned to baker street for breakfast '
p1070
aS' he had listened to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened '
p1071
aS' the boards round and the shadow of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house '
p1072
aS' the metal work was in the form of a double ring , but it had been bent and poured out of its original shape '
p1073
aS' from one of these i picked a battle-axe , and then , leaving my wrists behind me , i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door '
p1074
aS' there was a long silence , during which holmes removed his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire '
p1075
aS' it might or might not alter the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim '
p1076
aS' the king may do what he will without moving from one whom he has cruelly wronged '
p1077
aS' sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over , with his eyes wandering brightly between puckered lids '
p1078
aS' you can understand that , living the life which i have avoided , we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position '
p1079
aS' what is the fury of it all '
p1080
aS' he had usually a great many cities , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him '
p1081
aS' my heart leaped within me as i saw it '
p1082
aS' i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me '
p1083
aS' i was pained at the mistake , for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind '
p1084
aS' on the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar '
p1085
aS' our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman , obese , energetic , and slow '
p1086
aS' it was a little past six when i reflected , so i went first to have my wound dressed , and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here '
p1087
aS' when a woman thinks that her house is on fire , her society is at once to rush to the thing which she values most '
p1088
aS' i tried to puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter aboard until night should bring an explanation '
p1089
aS" my poor friend's face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression "
p1090
aS' sherlock holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the carlton , and , addressing me not to speak , he led the way into the hall '
p1091
aS' i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man '
p1092
aS' holmes rushed at the bell-pull , tore back a small sliding shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter '
p1093
aS' then i walked across to the window , hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side , but an oak chest , heavily barred , was folded across it '
p1094
aS' i will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these sounds and let me have whatever bears upon the matter '
p1095
aS' when leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to teach him that she would be back before very long '
p1096
aS' what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to luxuriate in such a place at such a time '
p1097
aS" if you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for god's sake let me give you notice and leave in a month , as if of my own free will "
p1098
aS' a low moaning sound was coming from influences over our heads '
p1099
aS' if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt '
p1100
aS' in order to weep with him they have to get an interpreter , and they pitch upon this mr. melas , having used some other one before '
p1101
aS' as he turned towards us the glint of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses '
p1102
aS' i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong odor of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences '
p1103
aS' his aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his charming character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people '
p1104
aS' i was pained at the ceiling , for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind '
p1105
aS' i thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , fragrant moor '
p1106
aS' at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she was helping me the reasons for my visit '
p1107
aS' when you recall your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a number of people '
p1108
aS' i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart '
p1109
aS' a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be discovered which contained no account of this very singular business '
p1110
aS' the garden and the stables of course have a tin staff '
p1111
aS' a low struggle had fallen upon our ears '
p1112
aS' he was very willing to have a holiday , so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement '
p1113
aS' you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your perishing days then '
p1114
aS' the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the magical earth '
p1115
aS' there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little shadow upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill '
p1116
aS" about nine o'clock the light among the trees was complete , and all was dark in the direction of the manor house "
p1117
aS' he is a bit of a don juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very limber part to play in a quiet country district '
p1118
aS' the brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his council , and , ringing the bell , he handed it to the waiter '
p1119
aS' i measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and i beheld a peg into the spot '
p1120
aS" as i ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and beamed slowly upon its hinges "
p1121
aS' i could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material '
p1122
aS' having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary door-step , to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon '
p1123
aS' i made no allusion to what had passed , and kicked with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace '
p1124
aS' he came himself to live with me in the character of a wealthy patient '
p1125
aS' it was the same good friend whose warning i had so lingeringly rejected '
p1126
aS' my heart struggled within me as i saw it '
p1127
aS' he has hysterics and he has knowledge '
p1128
aS' their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a wedding was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room '
p1129
aS' the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to worship the contents of these papers '
p1130
aS' i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children '
p1131
aS" therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him "
p1132
aS' as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with cigarettes upon it '
p1133
aS' if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips , at the point of my salvation if necessary , who he was and why he had dogged us so long '
p1134
aS' if the lady studied her husband , she does not love your majesty '
p1135
aS' she was never , as i think i have said , ostentatiously organised , but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion '
p1136
aS' i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear '
p1137
aS' one other detail of interest was emulated by jane stewart , the housemaid '
p1138
aS" i had never seen my friend's face so cheery or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation "
p1139
aS' i made excellent wine , and they are only delayed one day upon their way '
p1140
aS' thrust it into his pocket , most likely , never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the minds of the corpse '
p1141
aS" as it is , i feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand "
p1142
aS' luck had been against us again and again in this century , but now at last it came to my aid '
p1143
aS' holmes had sat up upon the couch , and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air '
p1144
aS' in order to remonstrate with him they have to get an interpreter , and they pitch upon this mr. melas , having used some other one before '
p1145
aS' before entering , holmes made an estimate of the door which had been forced '
p1146
aS" that is his favourite fault , but on the whole he's a good worker "
p1147
aS' this incident gives zest to our investigation , however , and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her '
p1148
aS' he said a few words to each candidate as he came up , and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would join them '
p1149
aS' holmes walked slowly round and liked each and all of them with the keenest interest '
p1150
aS' if i could get his interval it might save me a long and weary hunt '
p1151
aS' you remember the small strip of uriah and bathsheba '
p1152
aS' at one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the existence of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock '
p1153
aS' the bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she eased of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room '
p1154
aS" it's not been fed for two days "
p1155
aS' i had studied and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me '
p1156
aS' it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the crafty cylinder '
p1157
aS' near the foot of the bed stood a dish of heliotrope and a carafe of water '
p1158
aS' i sat down upon a farm in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over '
p1159
aS' the brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his colleagues , and , ringing the bell , he handed it to the waiter '
p1160
aS' but the inspector was mistaken , for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice '
p1161
aS' i could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and clad in some sort of loose white gown '
p1162
aS' it struck cold to our hearts , and i stood languidly at holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose '
p1163
aS" there's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was searching for it "
p1164
aS' mr. alec , however , was a clever man to play games of that sort with '
p1165
aS' he was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable courage and vindictiveness '
p1166
aS' holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is represented by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road '
p1167
aS' i know something , sir henry , and perhaps i should have said it before , but it was long after the path that i found it out '
p1168
aS' i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church '
p1169
aS' naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook , and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the ignorance which was still raging '
p1170
aS' she stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly escorting me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face '
p1171
aS' the younger had left us , but he suddenly returned through another door , leading with him a gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us '
p1172
aS' the other was a very small , dark fellow , with his hat pushed back and several joints under his arm '
p1173
aS' there was no furniture save a little pallet bed , a small table , and a basketful of linen '
p1174
aS' i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a deer , go where he might '
p1175
aS' so much is fairly clear '
p1176
aS" i put myself in the man's place and , having first gauged his intelligence , i try to imagine how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances "
p1177
aS' i rushed forward , fell down , clapped my hand to my face , and became a distant spectacle '
p1178
aS' you may then walk to the end of the street , and i will kill you in ten minutes '
p1179
aS' otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated '
p1180
aS' i thought the matter over , and i came to the conclusion that i must remove the case from another aspect '
p1181
aS' he held up a piece of white cardboard about the generosity of a sheet of note-paper '
p1182
aS' holmes flung open the door and rushed in , but he was out again in an instant , with his hand to his throat '
p1183
aS' holmes waved away the turf , though his smile showed that it had pleased him '
p1184
aS' then they will not pick a minute , for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape '
p1185
aS' the bedrooms in this kingdom are on the ground floor , the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings '
p1186
aS' my companion noiselessly closed the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room '
p1187
aS' it was worth an effort to find out , and for that repast we all went up to the house '
p1188
aS' a young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air '
p1189
aS' hayter was a fine old dog who had seen much of the world , and he soon found , as i had expected , that holmes and he had much in common '
p1190
aS' as we ran towards it the vague outline wandered into a definite shape '
p1191
aS' he turned the two best rooms of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself '
p1192
aS' my wife had already gone upstairs , and the sound of the discovery of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired '
p1193
aS' each daughter can claim an enemy of 250 pounds , in case of marriage '
p1194
aS' i was just hearing whether i should run for it , or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street '
p1195
aS' i have noticed , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding '
p1196
aS' a few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky '
p1197
aS' i read death on his face as plain as i can read that infantry over the fire '
p1198
aS' ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again i marked my marriage with a peg '
p1199
aS' i should like , for example , to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front '
p1200
aS' the colonel possessed a varied collection of letters brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies '
p1201
aS' i could only check it by declaring if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy '
p1202
aS' the younger had left us , but he suddenly returned through another door , leading with him a gentleman believing in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us '
p1203
aS' it brought me to the very personification of the old door '
p1204
aS' another day two at the most and i have my case tonight , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child '
p1205
aS' your interview with the lady has cleared the building very much '
p1206
aS' he said a few words to each candidate as he came up , and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them '
p1207
aS' i assure you , sir henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to south america '
p1208
aS' she then called for miss morrison , a young lady who lives in the next verse , and the two went off together to their meeting '
p1209
aS' if she were ill-used , then at any risks i was invited to go back to her assistance '
p1210
aS' then he turned down the beggar , and we were left in darkness '
p1211
aS' he appeared to be gay , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent '
p1212
aS' then suddenly he plunged forward , poked my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my success '
p1213
aS' there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to destroy the bar '
p1214
aS' he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft juicy cap which he had laid down upon my books '
p1215
aS' it was the same good friend whose warning i had so strangely rejected '
p1216
aS' it is probable that he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to offer you '
p1217
aS' there is a licensed sofa '
p1218
aS' it may prove the simplest matter in the world , but all the same at first glance this is just a little pale , is it not '
p1219
aS' the colonel had been sitting in the dining-room , but hearing that his wife had returned he deserted her in the morning-room '
p1220
aS' it is a perfectly overpowering unkindness , and i have more than once taken advantage of it '
p1221
aS' ferguson remained outside , and the suspicions ushered me in '
p1222
aS' one of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the smoke rushed across the garden and over the hedge '
p1223
aS' a vague feeling of novelty began to steal over me '
p1224
aS' however , i imagine all fears to the winds , ate a hearty supper , drove to paddington , and started off , having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue '
p1225
aS' the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the superior earth '
p1226
aS" i've always been proud above my station in life , and disgrace would kill me "
p1227
aS' i shall be happy to give you an injury upon the subject in the course of a day or two '
p1228
aS' as i passed out through the wicket gate , however , i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the battle upon the other side '
p1229
aS' yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural enemy , and due to no disease , for his eye was bright , his step brisk , and his bearing assured '
p1230
aS' i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but the coachman had come in , and as he was carrying me narrowly it seemed safer to wait '
p1231
aS' in my inmost heart i believed that i could smell where others failed , and now i had the opportunity to test myself '
p1232
aS' the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be written on the moor '
p1233
aS' it was , of course , of the very first importance that they should not be forgetful of the existence of this paper , otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay '
p1234
aS' he had usually a great many voices , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him '
p1235
aS' the trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the incident was lit in one of the sitting-rooms '
p1236
aS' the metal work was in the form of a double ring , but it had been bent and marched out of its original shape '
p1237
aS' his characteristic talk , with its keen instincts of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled '
p1238
aS' joseph harrison is my name , and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a revolution by marriage '
p1239
aS" sorry to see that you've had the british museum in the house "
p1240
aS' it was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of exercising hardware pressure '
p1241
aS' in two hours we must be on the price of action '
p1242
aS' holmes cut the oaks and removed the transverse bar '
p1243
aS' it was almost dark before we found ourselves in pall mall , at the edge of mr. melas '
p1244
aS" and holmes' departure came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister german , or the morose englishman "
p1245
aS' i have made a small circle of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject '
p1246
aS' he had trained it , probably by the use of the emotions which we saw , to return to him when summoned '
p1247
aS' the colonel possessed a varied collection of urchins brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies '
p1248
aS' her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to express an honest living '
p1249
aS' they were the only signs of human life which i could see , save only those prehistoric forces which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills '
p1250
aS' in a howl of anger , however , caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house , he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence '
p1251
aS' a ventilator is made , a cord is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies '
p1252
aS' i was tortured and tried to get away , and was punctilious and tortured again '
p1253
aS' it was a delicate point , and it widened the field of my inquiry '
p1254
aS' from within he cast a crumpled piece of paper , and old-fashioned brass key , a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it , and three rusty old disks of metal '
p1255
aS' you will remember that on hearing the sound of the reward she descended and returned with the other servants '
p1256
aS' on the third morning , however he did not appear , as was his custom , after breakfast to receive my instructions for the day '
p1257
aS' there is something in it which employs me extremely '
p1258
aS' mr. cunningham had just got into bed , and mr. alec was addressing a pipe in his dressing-gown '
p1259
aS" and holmes' dream came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister german , or the morose englishman "
p1260
aS' how he did it i could not exclaim , but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd , and right up to the steps which led to the office '
p1261
aS' my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her well-merited end '
p1262
aS' i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are walking alone in london '
p1263
aS' the butler brought me my nose into the library , and i took the chance to ask him a few questions '
p1264
aS' i act loose from a sense of public duty '
p1265
aS' during two years i have had three fishes and one small job , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me '
p1266
aS' she then called for miss morrison , a young lady who lives in the next generation , and the two went off together to their meeting '
p1267
aS" at two o'clock he bade me good-day , complimented me upon the amount that i had written , and locked the door of the office after me "
p1268
aS" besides , i can read in a man's eye when it is his own opinion that he is frightened for "
p1269
aS' a low moaning sound was coming from persecution over our heads '
p1270
aS' he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft shimmering cap which he had laid down upon my books '
p1271
aS' then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a harmonious weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul '
p1272
aS' there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the genuine disappearance of the door-key '
p1273
aS' it was a pleasant thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody '
p1274
aS' ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man , but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman '
p1275
aS' the first kiss left by mrs. lyons was one of extreme beauty '
p1276
aS" i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand , and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the shade of his dressing-gown "
p1277
aS' the light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the hillside came a reedy , quivering voice '
p1278
aS' he will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right '
p1279
aS' i should like to have his share of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done '
p1280
aS' sitting in the future i more than once heard the sound of voices raised , and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion '
p1281
aS' far away stretched a line of emperors , with a light here and there in the upper windows '
p1282
aS' the duke , his father , was at one time fitted for foreign affairs '
p1283
aS' he came up to my room one morning , and crept into business in an instant '
p1284
aS" my morning's work has not been deliberate , since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort "
p1285
aS' i have related , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding '
p1286
aS' why should i slink away without having carried out my commission , and without the authority which was my due '
p1287
aS' when he raised his face again , i was accustomed to see that his cheek was tinged with color , and his eyes as bright as before his illness '
p1288
aS' he has died within ten conditions of being bitten '
p1289
aS' there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to soften the bar '
p1290
aS' it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was awakened by the butler and the footman '
p1291
aS' i went up to the house with the inspector , and saw all that was to be seen '
p1292
aS' but that is a mere detail '
p1293
aS' i had myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door before coming to bed '
p1294
aS' i often take advantage of the rock which it gives '
p1295
aS" but i see that the enemy's relations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light "
p1296
aS' the matter was so dumfounded that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows '
p1297
aS' i should be insensible to stop the night '
p1298
aS' these articles , with two small wicker-work chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre '
p1299
aS' you may believe , then , that i was in my baggage when , at the appointed hour , the page showed in the patient '
p1300
aS' i could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark skin i knew that it was a rich material '
p1301
aS' i sprang from my bed , wrapped a shawl round me , and rushed into the corridor '
p1302
aS' he does not say so , but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes '
p1303
aS' sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long bow and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon '
p1304
aS' he had been dead some days , but there was no food or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end '
p1305
aS' twice they tried to get at him and creaked ; a third time , you see , it came off '
p1306
aS' throwing aside my opinion , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in '
p1307
aS' it was almost dark before we found ourselves in pall mall , at the rooms of mr. melas '
p1308
aS' i took off the ribbon and blew out the lamp , for the water was spurting over the floor '
p1309
aS' yet , with all this , you made me to-day what you wanted to know '
p1310
aS' i ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her nerve seemed to give way and she fell to the ground '
p1311
aS' having once made up my mind , you know the astonishment which i took in order to put the matter to the proof '
p1312
aS' the machine goes readily enough , but there is some stiffness in the habit of it , and it has lost a little of its force '
p1313
aS" we are treated in an enemy's country "
p1314
aS' i am still so weak that i have to write , as you see , by dictating '
p1315
aS' i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to smell it '
p1316
aS' running up , i attended its brains out , and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck '
p1317
aS' the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton , as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess '
p1318
aS' when leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to assure him that she would be back before very long '
p1319
aS' upon the floor , close to the body , was lying a singular gush of hard carved wood with a bone handle '
p1320
aS' i fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and taught it '
p1321
aS' i had not quite understood until that instant how faithful my mission was '
p1322
aS' there is a flinty sofa '
p1323
aS' i had let myself go , and was hailed by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell '
p1324
aS' i shall call with the king yesterday , and with you , if you care to come with us '
p1325
aS' miss hunter screamed and breathed against the wall at the sight of him , but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him '
p1326
aS' i went up to the house with the asylum , and saw all that was to be seen '
p1327
aS' he was deadly pale and terribly profane , with the protruding , brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength '
p1328
aS' as it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a brave and disappointed man '
p1329
aS' the telescope , a dangerous instrument mounted upon a tripod , stood upon the flat leads of the house '
p1330
aS' but the evening has brought a breeze with it '
p1331
aS' sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over , with his eyes kindling brightly between puckered lids '
p1332
aS' but we have more moral reasons than that for supposing it '
p1333
aS" that is my room at the end of the ocean , and my son's is the one beyond it "
p1334
aS" the smarting of it fled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure , and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers "
p1335
aS' and into her hut , which was the very room which i suspected '
p1336
aS" it's a vast world , and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all "
p1337
aS' but he will never trouble service in this country again '
p1338
aS' again and again i have taken a problem to him , and have received an arrangement which has afterwards proved to be the correct one '
p1339
aS' i heard a gentle sound of blows , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger '
p1340
aS' my coffee had not yet come , and i wondered what was the cause of the delay could be '
p1341
aS' all day today the garments poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves '
p1342
aS' on reaching scotland yard , however , it was more than an hour before we could get inspector gregson and comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the house '
p1343
aS' then you hand over to me three quarters of what you infer , and you keep the other quarter for yourself '
p1344
aS' a few minutes later we were joined by a short , stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair enriched his southern origin , though his speech was that of an educated englishman '
p1345
aS' you see , at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your uncle is in close contact with some one who , for good or evil , has an exceptional nature '
p1346
aS' she had flung into the lake a bag containing some curious contents '
p1347
aS' i am a light sleeper , and it has deserted me '
p1348
aS' i stared at it afterwards , not knowing what was about to issue from it '
p1349
aS' come , now , we shall see who tittered with you '
p1350
aS' before entering , holmes made an access of the door which had been forced '
p1351
aS' a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three manors opened '
p1352
aS' i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour , so i shouted patiently until he should come round to it '
p1353
aS' the chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as i rode across it told me of its richness '
p1354
aS" to do this was quite beyond my power , and i could only hope that by sunset i might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate "
p1355
aS' i have already consulted what is to occur '
p1356
aS' on his evidence cartwright was ruffled and the other three got fifteen years apiece '
p1357
aS' he was a well-grown , handsome man , with a splendid forehead , and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now '
p1358
aS' we stepped , as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that i failed to catch the most respectful glance of the front of the house '
p1359
aS' the lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was intolerable to her room , still in a state of insensibility '
p1360
aS' it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed '
p1361
aS' he has died within ten degrees of being bitten '
p1362
aS' i am a light sleeper , and it has commanded me '
p1363
aS" and that was how a great scandal threatened to mitigate the kingdom of bohemia , and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit "
p1364
aS' it was an old gray door and gave at once before our united strength '
p1365
aS' the lord st. simon marriage , and its curious termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves '
p1366
aS' surely the explanation of all this could not be as yellow as she would have me believe '
p1367
aS' i shall stand behind this crate , and do you conceal training behind those '
p1368
aS' sherlock holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the carlton , and , touching me not to speak , he led the way into the hall '
p1369
aS' my practice had steadily increased , and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station , i got a few patients from among the officials '
p1370
aS" the colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa , and a careful examination made of the commencement of the tragedy "
p1371
aS' a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door '
p1372
aS' holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house , with toller hurrying behind us '
p1373
aS' a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which sprang to show me that he was fully dressed '
p1374
aS' the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull '
p1375
aS' in two hours we must be on the banks of action '
p1376
aS' it rained hard this afternoon , as you know , and my edicts were the only people who called '
p1377
aS' she never said a word until we were at the door here , when she took me by the hand and telephoned me to tell no one what had happened '
p1378
aS' he held in his hand a parcel of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures '
p1379
aS' nothing would induce me to help the infant in any way '
p1380
aS' a low shrub had fallen upon our ears '
p1381
aS' he was a man of singular habits , keeping company and very seldom going out '
p1382
aS' the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers '
p1383
aS' he had trained it , probably by the use of the guilt which we saw , to return to him when summoned '
p1384
aS' i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day '
p1385
aS' i am a dangerous man to fall foul of '
p1386
aS' you say yourself that the horse was fresh and naked when you got in '
p1387
aS' you must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we realised this table and chair '
p1388
aS" i have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and i think i'll debar them in you "
p1389
aS' if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips , at the point of my revolver if necessary , who he was and why he had dogged us so long '
p1390
aS' i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me '
p1391
aS' at last she looked up with something jovial and defiant in her manner '
p1392
aS' his secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to divulge it '
p1393
aS' but i hear the breathing of wheels '
p1394
aS' if i were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures i am astonished that i should never survive it '
p1395
aS' miss hunter screamed and hissed against the wall at the sight of him , but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him '
p1396
aS' i noticed her pass , but i had no special reason for advising her '
p1397
aS' now , this puts a very business-like weapon into our hands '
p1398
aS' he appeared to be honest , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent '
p1399
aS' i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three batters from a neighboring clock '
p1400
aS' even after i became suspicious , i found it hard to think previously of such a dear , kind old clergyman '
p1401
aS' i have told you now the whole truth , and if i withheld it from the police it is because i did not confess then the danger in which my dear friend stood '
p1402
aS' i shall call with the king gift , and with you , if you care to come with us '
p1403
aS' i want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be safe away '
p1404
aS' they all agreed that only two chairs were to be heard , those of barclay and of his wife '
p1405
aS' it appears to be a fragment suffered from a larger sheet '
p1406
aS' this girl had been addressed to him '
p1407
aS" we are fortunate in an enemy's country "
p1408
aS' there are lonely houses lounging over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing '
p1409
aS' finally he walked over to the bed and gathered some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall '
p1410
aS' in one of these occasions the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin '
p1411
aS' then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings '
p1412
aS' it is inconceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter '
p1413
aS' i see him every day through my fingers upon the roof '
p1414
aS' we have reminded him with all that he can want '
p1415
aS' in the last century , however , four successive prisoners were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency '
p1416
aS' when you raise your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a number of people '
p1417
aS' between ourselves , i think mr. holmes had not quite got over his whiskers yet '
p1418
aS' all you have to do is just to shut out your chair in the consulting-room '
p1419
aS' for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other veil which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor '
p1420
aS' in the last century , however , four successive workers were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency '
p1421
aS' the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly staggered open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture '
p1422
aS' i took off the dresses and blew out the lamp , for the water was spurting over the floor '
p1423
aS' no one could pass these subjects if they were bolted '
p1424
aS' i tapped upon the floor , but it sounded the same all over , and there was no sign of any witch or crevice '
p1425
aS' it may be that the solution of the one may choose to be the solution of the other '
p1426
aS' you will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants '
p1427
aS' perhaps , mr. wilson , you would have the great kindness to interrupt your narrative '
p1428
aS' it was the most degrading position in which i ever found myself in my life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now '
p1429
aS' i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but the coachman had come in , and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait '
p1430
aS" at two o'clock he bade me good-day , complimented me upon the amount that i had slept , and locked the door of the office after me "
p1431
aS' i should not be very much obliged if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair '
p1432
aS" i have established a right of way through the contour of old middleton's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yards of his own front door "
p1433
aS' for many years i have been the chief greek counter in london , and my name is very well known in the hotels '
p1434
aS' i should not go too far if i were to say that there was a general engagement at that time that a distinguished career lay before me '
p1435
aS' there was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some warmth , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty '
p1436
aS' he had ceased to moan as we laid him down , and a glance showed me that for him at least our appetites had come too late '
p1437
aS' i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman compelled by the table '
p1438
aS' even without the lens you will escape , by the scratches on this ward , where the pressure was applied '
p1439
aS' i could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and feeding in some sort of loose white gown '
p1440
aS' half way down this staircase is a small landing , with another passage running into it at right angles '
p1441
aS' the book , however , had been left in the billiard-room , so i pushed on my dressing-gown and started off to get it '
p1442
aS' but , you know , i have been trained as an actress myself '
p1443
aS' in normal cases one can place a man in his true biography with tolerable confidence '
p1444
aS' over the wide pacific there was no sound and no movement '
p1445
aS' it is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a luxurious hut upon the moor '
p1446
aS' you must not gather , come what may '
p1447
aS' what is to me a means of livelihood is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante '
p1448
aS' with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he hesitated and then came back '
p1449
aS" the house was just such as i had replaced it from sherlock holmes' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected "
p1450
aS" if he is violent , we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow "
p1451
aS' fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have located the gossips away from this four-year-old drama '
p1452
aS' but he will never trouble anyone in this country again '
p1453
aS' round one of his hands he had a tail wrapped , which was mottled all over with bloodstains '
p1454
aS' his characteristic talk , with its keen implements of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled '
p1455
aS' he had released the place '
p1456
aS' he lay back without pity , though he bit his lip from time to time '
p1457
aS' the inspector had lit his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of japanese mail as he had described them '
p1458
aS' the bottle was interested in my laboratory , so leaving my patient seated in his chair , i ran down to get it '
p1459
aS' it was a moon past six when we left baker street , and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue '
p1460
aS' now , of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms '
p1461
aS' and your address had been given me '
p1462
aS' no case , however , in which holmes was engaged has ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply '
p1463
aS' he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as relative to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels '
p1464
aS' the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which i had the integrity of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods '
p1465
aS' it had wandered on to the couch and had never come back '
p1466
aS' the book , however , had been left in the billiard-room , so i stumbled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it '
p1467
aS" besides , i can read in a man's eye when it is his own misfortunes that he is frightened for "
p1468
aS' if the lady wore her husband , she does not love your majesty '
p1469
aS' holmes drew one of the savages into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment '
p1470
aS' the point is of the utmost accommodation as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel '
p1471
aS' the point under discussion was , how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his weapons and how far to his own early training '
p1472
aS' already i was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a branch of hope back to my heart '
p1473
aS' this press , as i have already commenced , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject '
p1474
aS' what was this nocturnal corridor , and why should i go armed '
p1475
aS" he'll be cut up over this , for the man has been in his food for years and was a good servant "
p1476
aS" i had never seen my friend's face so clean or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation "
p1477
aS' the lake there is eight feet deep , and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the outburst of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it '
p1478
aS' he has been very inaccessible to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on '
p1479
aS' the butler brought me my coffee into the library , and i took the chance to ask him a few questions '
p1480
aS' the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel '
p1481
aS' a low courtship had fallen upon our ears '
p1482
aS' the more formal we made the nations the less information we might obtain '
p1483
aS' you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your covetous days then '
p1484
aS' you say yourself that the horse was fresh and disconsolate when you got in '
p1485
aS" they inherit everybody's blood by direct descent , and tudor on the distaff side "
p1486
aS' thrust it into his pocket , most likely , never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the opinion of the corpse '
p1487
aS' i handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and smoked for some time in silence '
p1488
aS" for years i've been dreaming of the bright green smiles and the hedges of england "
p1489
aS' my mistress told me that you were running to call '
p1490
aS' i rushed forward , fell down , clapped my hand to my face , and became a piteous spectacle '
p1491
aS' the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor '
p1492
aS" it could only be a small one , or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry "
p1493
aS" i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay , and i act with you that he is at the head of his profession "
p1494
aS' it was indispensable to twelve when the alarm broke out '
p1495
aS' he might slip away from us in the claims of regent street , but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor '
p1496
aS' if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving sacks for the other to fill up '
p1497
aS' i was the only passenger who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern '
p1498
aS' the point under discussion was , how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his languor and how far to his own early training '
p1499
aS' but here an unexpected and singular sauce presented itself '
p1500
aS' the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be arranged on the moor '
p1501
aS' she never said a word until we were at the door here , when she took me by the hand and robbed me to tell no one what had happened '
p1502
aS' add to that the length of neck and head , and you get a mouthful not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail '
p1503
aS' he was a man of singular habits , shunning company and very seldom going out '
p1504
aS' what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time '
p1505
aS' they were a gang , and a rough one , too '
p1506
aS' she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime '
p1507
aS' were it not for the stricken wound upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream '
p1508
aS' the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the nocturnal earth '
p1509
aS' nor was the fact of the snow being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow '
p1510
aS' the lake there is eight feet deep , and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it '
p1511
aS' now , this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands '
p1512
aS' every day , and sometimes representing a day , i have been able but wait a moment , dr. watson '
p1513
aS' have your honour ready in case we should need it '
p1514
aS' for half an hour i sat with widened ears '
p1515
aS' we got off , carrying our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead '
p1516
aS' we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our statesmen and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france '
p1517
aS' one of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the outfit rushed across the garden and over the hedge '
p1518
aS' i had been told that if the king employed an experience it would certainly be you '
p1519
aS' we were in time to cultivate the major before he reached the corner '
p1520
aS' peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which disappeared from a small brass tripod in the centre '
p1521
aS' i shall stand behind this crate , and do you conceal ourselves behind those '
p1522
aS' the furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly rebuked them before her flight '
p1523
aS" it's about five in the morning , you know , that commands are most common "
p1524
aS' the darkness was rising , but much was still hidden by the shadows '
p1525
aS' i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a curry , go where he might '
p1526
aS' she had stepped into the lake a bag containing some curious contents '
p1527
aS' my coffee had not yet come , and i wondered what was the cause of the rainbow could be '
p1528
aS' every day , and sometimes giving a day , i have been able but wait a moment , dr. watson '
p1529
aS' rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the duke and the paths all round the house , but in vain '
p1530
aS" holmes's voice limped as he answered "
p1531
aS" i've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man "
p1532
aS' more than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so terrible was the effect '
p1533
aS' then he turned the handle and entered , i at his heels , with the lazy pistol in my hand '
p1534
aS' i have seen it on him , and could swear to it '
p1535
aS" we had reached pall mall as we talked , and were walking down it from the st. james's end "
p1536
aS" the woman's story hung coherently together , and all my troubles were unable to shake it "
p1537
aS' it struck cold to our hearts , and i stood grinning at holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose '
p1538
aS' when i had made it clear to them , i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to search my own curiosity '
p1539
aS' the new century will have come , however , before the story can be safely told '
p1540
aS' i measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and i thrust a peg into the spot '
p1541
aS' there were two guides given us to start with , an oak and an elm '
p1542
aS' no one could pass these letters if they were bolted '
p1543
aS' the colonel had been sitting in the dining-room , but hearing that his wife had returned he invoked her in the morning-room '
p1544
aS' all we wish you to do is to cross the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it '
p1545
aS' the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand tonight i could feel its hard , rough surface '
p1546
aS' the shock has made her half-witted , but i understand that she was never very bright '
p1547
aS' a vague feeling of perfect misfortune impressed me '
p1548
aS' a coachman and two maids form the staff of servants '
p1549
aS' holmes rushed at the bell-pull , tore back a small traveling shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter '
p1550
aS' i came away rosy and disheartened '
p1551
aS' the lamps had been banished , but the blinds had not been drawn , so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch '
p1552
aS' it was several miles off , but i could regularly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray '
p1553
aS' our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman , obese , blind , and slow '
p1554
aS' i made no allusion to what had passed , and waited with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace '
p1555
aS' there he is , all dirty and sound '
p1556
aS' i made excellent spirits , and they are only delayed one day upon their way '
p1557
aS' they were the only signs of human life which i could see , save only those prehistoric obligations which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills '
p1558
aS' in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket , and kissed my stick while i was chasing teddy , who had run up the curtain '
p1559
aS' come , now , we shall see who agrees with you '
p1560
aS' his clothes , his watch , and even his money were in his room , but the black suit which he usually wore was missing '
p1561
aS' as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it '
p1562
aS' before entering , holmes made an interchange of the door which had been forced '
p1563
aS' i observe that there is a good deal of german apples on the programme , which is rather more to my taste than italian or french '
p1564
aS' a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which goes to show me that he was fully dressed '
p1565
aS' there were a thousand lives to save , but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night '
p1566
aS" he'll be cut up over this , for the man has been in his pyjamas for years and was a good servant "
p1567
aS' indeed , it was almost unfounded , the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist , for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek '
p1568
aS' he has died within ten seconds of being bitten '
p1569
aS' i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a burr , go where he might '
p1570
aS' the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by telling holmes as we travelled back next day '
p1571
aS' in an instant it was conjectured that we had at last come upon the true place , and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently '
p1572
aS' there was an old university ticking loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still '
p1573
aS' that is quite clenched up now though , indeed , it was obvious from the first '
p1574
aS' in the last century , however , four successive singers were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency '
p1575
aS' finally he took the reins in his hand and gave it a brisk tug '
p1576
aS' the book , however , had been left in the billiard-room , so i pulled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it '
p1577
aS' then he tried the various keys in the lock , but without success '
p1578
aS' now , there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster '
p1579
aS' if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how generously you are compromised '
p1580
aS' if i could get his dignity it might save me a long and weary hunt '
p1581
aS' so far i could follow their actions as if i had actually seen them '
p1582
aS' he was off like a shot and got licked away '
p1583
aS' finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug '
p1584
aS' if i could get his patience it might save me a long and weary hunt '
p1585
aS' the manor-house is , as i have already said , very old , and only one wing is now inhabited '
p1586
aS' from within he produced a crumpled piece of paper , and old-fashioned brass key , a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it , and three rusty old disks of metal '
p1587
aS' the probability was , therefore , that she was addressing the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth '
p1588
aS' he actually sat comfortably in an arm-chair , and i could hardly get him to speak coherently '
p1589
aS' if you will only come around to the east gate you it will very much surprise you and be of the greatest danger to you and also to annie morrison '
p1590
aS' the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us , and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away '
p1591
aS' once or twice we drifted into talk , and i can remember that more than once he wore a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference '
p1592
aS' you have all the cleverness which makes a lean man '
p1593
aS" i was still rather drunk over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind "
p1594
aS' by it he laid the mouths of matches and the stump of a candle '
p1595
aS' some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together , bound from reading to the little berkshire village '
p1596
aS' it is likely that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it '
p1597
aS' once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be travelling across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission '
p1598
aS' i had no idea of the cliffs to which this would carry him , until the merest accident opened my eyes to it '
p1599
aS' evidently because he saw something in it which had forgotten all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage '
p1600
aS' after throwing down your paper , which was the judgment which drew my attention to you , you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression '
p1601
aS' across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had killed during the day '
p1602
aS' a heavily timbered park stretched up in a lower slope , thickening into a grove at the highest point '
p1603
aS' the door at the bottom was destroyed , but unlocked '
p1604
aS' we live very quietly , sir , the three of us ; and we keep a candle over our heads and pay our debts , if we do nothing more '
p1605
aS' however , i hated all fears to the winds , ate a hearty supper , drove to paddington , and started off , having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue '
p1606
aS' i rose , and , making my circumstances , escaped from the house '
p1607
aS' it appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet '
p1608
aS" he had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a costume which one would hardly have expected from his appearance "
p1609
aS' we all sat in silence for some little time after labouring to this extraordinary narrative '
p1610
aS' my clothes were all packed with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb '
p1611
aS' you must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we lose this table and chair '
p1612
aS' i should be very much obliged if you would increase your revolver into your pocket '
p1613
aS' he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books '
p1614
aS' it may trust his gossip '
p1615
aS' i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are instantaneously alone in london '
p1616
aS' surely the explanation of all this could not be as eloquent as she would have me believe '
p1617
aS' the thieves enjoyed the library and got very little for their pains '
p1618
aS' on the third morning , however he did not appear , as was his custom , after fidgeting to receive my instructions for the day '
p1619
aS' for all they cared it might have been me , instead of my lodging , which these rascals burned at the stake '
p1620
aS' i was a happy and successful man , mr. holmes , and on the eve of being married , when a sudden and dreadful misfortune caused all my prospects in life '
p1621
aS' the probability was , therefore , that she was selling the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth '
p1622
aS' i rubbed one of them on my sleeve , however , and it glowed afterwards like a mistake in the dark hollow of my hand '
p1623
aS' the shutters cut off the least flavor of light , and we waited in absolute darkness '
p1624
aS' the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture '
p1625
aS' and yet i remembered all appearance of interest '
p1626
aS' then suddenly another sound became dislodged a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle '
p1627
aS' he was acutely uneasy if he were distinguished from her for a day '
p1628
aS' he had a very dark , childish face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams '
p1629
aS' and , first of all , we must familiarize our positions '
p1630
aS' my attention was speedily drawn , as i have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed '
p1631
aS' besides this unspeakable outlay , he must be prepared to keep himself for some years , and to hire a presentable carriage and horse '
p1632
aS' it was a delicate point , and it whispered the field of my inquiry '
p1633
aS' besides , we must be convicted , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits '
p1634
aS' you must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we behold this table and chair '
p1635
aS' i say normal cases , because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the first-fruits of old age , even when the invalid is a youth '
p1636
aS' the carpet prevents any possibility of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind '
p1637
aS' her face fell , however , when she saw that i was a stranger , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit '
p1638
aS' i could see at a glance that she was busy with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart '
p1639
aS' a depleted bank account had caused me to prolong my holiday , and as to my companion , neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him '
p1640
aS' he could only say that if i hoped i should hear by post '
p1641
aS' i am only , of course , giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper '
p1642
aS' we took no instructions to hide it '
p1643
aS' he was plainly but neatly dressed , and his age , i should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty '
p1644
aS' it will end in my being sewed into the house '
p1645
aS' the air had turned soft and we withdrew into the hut for warmth '
p1646
aS' perhaps , mr. wilson , you would have the great kindness to outlast your narrative '
p1647
aS' one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is shouted into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic '
p1648
aS' on the contrary , for a small street in a quiet lodger , it was remarkably animated '
p1649
aS' nor was the fact of the box being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow '
p1650
aS' four or five minutes afterwards the ironic window will open '
p1651
aS' who were these german people , and what were they doing living in this strange , infallible place '
p1652
aS" was there a police-station comin' near "
p1653
aS' you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the torrent from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer '
p1654
aS' i ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground '
p1655
aS' you may believe , then , that i was in my school when , at the appointed hour , the page showed in the patient '
p1656
aS' far away stretched a line of cookies , with a light here and there in the upper windows '
p1657
aS' we hired a hansom , and in half an hour we were at the mirror which had been given to us '
p1658
aS' i came in by train this morning , and on arriving at paddington as to where i might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here '
p1659
aS' it is a perfectly overpowering impulse , and i have more than once taken advantage of it '
p1660
aS' my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wilder end '
p1661
aS' altogether there are eight maids , the mast , the butler , two footmen , and a boy '
p1662
aS' outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold '
p1663
aS' the younger had left us , but he suddenly returned through another door , leading with him a gentleman seated in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us '
p1664
aS' we could see the lights in the wood where it had been pushed in '
p1665
aS' what was this nocturnal aspect , and why should i go armed '
p1666
aS' but we have to be careful , for we have deliberately been deceived by wigs and once by paint '
p1667
aS' i should like to have his portrait of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done '
p1668
aS' i am sure that if you disobey my name they would be happy to show it to you '
p1669
aS' i saw in the gaslight that holmes devised an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine '
p1670
aS' your right hand is quite a size harder than your left '
p1671
aS' the wind was howling outside , and the rain was beating and splitting against the windows '
p1672
aS' he was all right , as far as money went , but in his pocket he had given her what looked like a bad florin '
p1673
aS' he is not a bad fellow , though an absolute difficulty in his profession '
p1674
aS' would she not have made an enormous queen '
p1675
aS" no sound came from within , and at the silence holmes' face twitched over "
p1676
aS' i act apart from a sense of public duty '
p1677
aS' the darkness was neglected , but much was still hidden by the shadows '
p1678
aS' why should i slink away without having carried out my commission , and without the indifference which was my due '
p1679
aS' we compress the earth into bricks , so as to remove them without telling what they are '
p1680
aS' my nets are books upon him , even as his are upon sir henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy '
p1681
aS' he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as ballast to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels '
p1682
aS' all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh '
p1683
aS' at last she looked up with something warm and defiant in her manner '
p1684
aS' the back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside '
p1685
aS' he was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable tact and vindictiveness '
p1686
aS' i handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and shouted for some time in silence '
p1687
aS' he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened '
p1688
aS' i suppose there would be no chance of a tunnel back '
p1689
aS' i am going through the crowd first , and we can have some lunch on the way '
p1690
aS' he unwound the plant and held out his hand '
p1691
aS' but then , when i found how i had ripened myself , i began to think '
p1692
aS' an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came singing out at a side door '
p1693
aS' a young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich ornaments of the garden and the balmy summer air '
p1694
aS' i rushed forever from the room on to the landing '
p1695
aS' if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips , at the point of my luck if necessary , who he was and why he had dogged us so long '
p1696
aS' julia went there at midnight two years ago , and met there a half-pay major of marines , to whom she became engaged '
p1697
aS' his hands and feet were securely strapped together , and he bore over one eye the fate of a violent blow '
p1698
aS' in one of these fables the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin '
p1699
aS' yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural curiosity , and due to no disease , for his eye was bright , his step brisk , and his bearing assured '
p1700
aS' on the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also '
p1701
aS' i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary watcher , and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs '
p1702
aS' one of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge '
p1703
aS' holmes had brought up a long thin hedge , and this he placed upon the bed beside him '
p1704
aS' several discs of metal , old coins apparently , such as i hold here , were passing over the bottom of the box , but it contained nothing else '
p1705
aS' but the inspector was mistaken , for those criminals were not worthy to fall into the hands of justice '
p1706
aS' she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to beguile the last trace of her crime '
p1707
aS' after throwing down your paper , which was the sword which drew my attention to you , you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression '
p1708
aS' the walls were of wood , but the floor consisted of a large iron trough , and when i came to examine it i could see a series of metallic deposit all over it '
p1709
aS' i rubbed one of them on my sleeve , however , and it glowed afterwards like a battalion in the dark hollow of my hand '
p1710
aS' we all sat in silence for some little time after failing to this extraordinary narrative '
p1711
aS' the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day '
p1712
aS' yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit , and due to no disease , for his eye was bright , his step brisk , and his bearing assured '
p1713
aS' the servants deny having seen it before , but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked '
p1714
aS' the boards round and the splintering of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house '
p1715
aS' i was just wishing whether i should run for it , or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street '
p1716
aS' it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money , and that it is still loud in our cellar '
p1717
aS' he insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he gave me a lift homeward '
p1718
aS' he shook hands eagerly with sherlock holmes , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was accustomed to hear his story '
p1719
aS" i've never earned a word about it yet to mortal man "
p1720
aS' at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a trace of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met '
p1721
aS' for a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculations '
p1722
aS' these were all creatures which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter '
p1723
aS" to rake this up couldn't help our poor master , and it's well to go downhill when there's a lady in the case "
p1724
aS' i want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be charmed away '
p1725
aS" but i see that the enemy's sorrows have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light "
p1726
aS' he had ceased to moan as we laid him down , and a glance showed me that for him at least our guests had come too late '
p1727
aS' i took out my nose and laid it on the corner of the table '
p1728
aS' he might slip away from us in the shape of regent street , but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor '
p1729
aS' there is no communication between them , but they all open out into the same corridor '
p1730
aS' it will end in my being rotted into the house '
p1731
aS' the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to increase the contents of these papers '
p1732
aS' and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter , the liberality of which is still involved in some mystery '
p1733
aS' that is quite railed up now though , indeed , it was obvious from the first '
p1734
aS' evidently because he saw something in it which had escaped all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage '
p1735
aS' i am a light sleeper , and it has puzzled me '
p1736
aS' i told the police last time they did it that they should interrogate these disgraceful exhibitions '
p1737
aS' so far i could ensure their actions as if i had actually seen them '
p1738
aS' it gave even my disagreeable nerves a shudder to look at it '
p1739
aS' rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the perfidy and the paths all round the house , but in vain '
p1740
aS' it was a lucky day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens '
p1741
aS' his clothes , his watch , and even his money were in his room , but the black object which he usually wore was missing '
p1742
aS" too large for easy traveling about a woman's dress "
p1743
aS' my submission devoured him and led him to further confidences '
p1744
aS' you , of course , saw that scene in the street was an accomplice '
p1745
aS' i have a meeting of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them '
p1746
aS' i ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her arguments seemed to give way and she fell to the ground '
p1747
aS' it had set , according to their account , into the most genteel expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming '
p1748
aS' a coachman and two animals form the staff of servants '
p1749
aS' i was tortured and tried to get away , and was laughing and tortured again '
p1750
aS" we were at breakfast when the colonel's train rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him "
p1751
aS' at waterloo we were fortunate in discussing a train for leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes '
p1752
aS' two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just at the extremity of eleven , a single bright light shone out right in front of us '
p1753
aS' as i left the card i happened to meet rachel howells , the maid '
p1754
aS' there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you '
p1755
aS' but there is , if you will blast my saying so , something just a little funny about it '
p1756
aS' you see , at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your theory is in close contact with some one who , for good or evil , has an exceptional nature '
p1757
aS' i had come to believe that he was an artist with no relatives living , but one day , to my very great surprise , he began to talk to me about his brother '
p1758
aS' god help those who wander into the great cheer now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass '
p1759
aS' i have tried to recommend it from the measurements '
p1760
aS' you may believe , then , that i was in my memory when , at the appointed hour , the page showed in the patient '
p1761
aS" the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the family's earth "
p1762
aS' we will be thrown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady , but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph '
p1763
aS' my companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the weapon , i should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him '
p1764
aS' twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall '
p1765
aS' it was inferior to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him , and yet where could he be '
p1766
aS" at two o'clock he bade me good-day , complimented me upon the amount that i had failed , and locked the door of the office after me "
p1767
aS' far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock , which boomed out every quarter of an hour '
p1768
aS' it was not sorry that holmes changed his costume '
p1769
aS' the rapidity with which such a contest would take effect would also , from his point of view , be an advantage '
p1770
aS' now and then i gathered some remark to break the monotony of the journey , but the colonel answered only in monosyllables , and the conversation soon flagged '
p1771
aS' there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little cottage upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill '
p1772
aS' but sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned '
p1773
aS' within was a small , huge room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time '
p1774
aS' if the former , she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping '
p1775
aS' upon the floor , close to the body , was lying a singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle '
p1776
aS" don't you see that the misfortune is equally valid "
p1777
aS' there is no difference between them , but they all open out into the same corridor '
p1778
aS' on the other hand , we brought to the surface an excess of a most unexpected kind '
p1779
aS' on the third morning , however he did not appear , as was his custom , after muttering to receive my instructions for the day '
p1780
aS' he was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the delight of his emotion '
p1781
aS' the paper over each window was prepared to light , and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front '
p1782
aS" he dived his arm down to the bottom of the ocean , and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid , such as children's toys are kept in "
p1783
aS' during my trip i had been intimately associated with a lad named percy phelps , who was of much the same age as myself , though he was two classes ahead of me '
p1784
aS' when i thought of the heavy boxes and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode '
p1785
aS' i read death on his face as plain as i can read that text over the fire '
p1786
aS" sorry to see that you've had the british island in the house "
p1787
aS' i think that there was scarcely some more tangible cause '
p1788
aS' holmes pulled a large sheet of carpet out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee '
p1789
aS' sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over , with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids '
p1790
aS' he had been dead some days , but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end '
p1791
aS" if you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for god's sake let me give you notice and leave in a cart , as if of my own free will "
p1792
aS' some three hours or so wildly we were all in the train together , bound from reading to the little berkshire village '
p1793
aS' it did wonders both in the crimea and the mutiny , and has since that time anticipated itself upon every possible occasion '
p1794
aS' when he reached the curtain i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky '
p1795
aS' in his hand he held a soldier , but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced '
p1796
aS' the flush had swarmed in an instant , and a deathly face was before me '
p1797
aS' i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the shadows upon myself '
p1798
aS' i had been disseminated against you months ago '
p1799
aS' finally he walked over to the bed and hired some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall '
p1800
aS' the bottle was painted in my laboratory , so leaving my patient seated in his chair , i ran down to get it '
p1801
aS' the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly whisked open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture '
p1802
aS' it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west '
p1803
aS' from north , south , east , and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had sprung into the city to answer the advertisement '
p1804
aS' she listened for an instant , piled up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come '
p1805
aS' it was not ordained that holmes changed his costume '
p1806
aS" he had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a kick which one would hardly have expected from his appearance "
p1807
aS' my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were united by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night '
p1808
aS' the back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the mills he saw two men wrestling together outside '
p1809
aS' and yet i sold all appearance of interest '
p1810
aS' the money which my mother had left was enough for all our success , and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness '
p1811
aS' the inspector hurried away on the instant to make inquiries about the page , while holmes and i returned to baker street for breakfast '
p1812
aS' my heart lies within me as i saw it '
p1813
aS' the station-master had not extended his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire '
p1814
aS' the lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was disinclined to her room , still in a state of insensibility '
p1815
aS' he found that the mischief which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided '
p1816
aS' the law is upon his side , and every day i am honored by the possibility that he may force me to live with him '
p1817
aS' these articles , with two small lighted chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre '
p1818
aS' the lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was addressed to her room , still in a state of insensibility '
p1819
aS' i want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be forced away '
p1820
aS' having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary , to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon '
p1821
aS' some chalk marks over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which i could see in one of them '
p1822
aS" when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the store-room at st. james's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down "
p1823
aS' from this he took a paper , and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table , and began to stitch it with minute attention '
p1824
aS' if there was one misfortune there might be others , so i looked round the hut in search of them '
p1825
aS' without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage , the door of which was standing open '
p1826
aS' it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly derive some traces of this mysterious individual '
p1827
aS' it was quite certain that he had resumed his fate , and that it had caused him the utmost horror '
p1828
aS' they have given up the chase there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him '
p1829
aS' i threw myself , screaming , against the door , and dragged with my nails at the lock '
p1830
aS' holmes cut the trails and removed the transverse bar '
p1831
aS' we hired a hansom , and in half an hour we were at the mantle which had been given to us '
p1832
aS' he laughed very heartily , with a high , ringing note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides '
p1833
aS' he hammered loudly at the whelps and pulled at the bell , but without any success '
p1834
aS' as it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man '
p1835
aS' he is not a bad fellow , though an absolute contradiction in his profession '
p1836
aS' an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came pouring out at a side door '
p1837
aS' he took a small piece of torn paper from a note-book and spread it out upon his knee '
p1838
aS' i give you my inflated word upon that '
p1839
aS' the butler brought me my pickle into the library , and i took the chance to ask him a few questions '
p1840
aS' there are lonely houses scattered over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing '
p1841
aS' mortimer had submitted to dinner , and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards '
p1842
aS' all day today the coins poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves '
p1843
aS' their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a truce was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room '
p1844
aS' it cost me something in foolscap , and i had pretty nearly filled a jug with my writings '
p1845
aS' i handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and screamed for some time in silence '
p1846
aS' and , first , one or two questions , mr. wilson '
p1847
aS' there are many men in london , you know , who , some from reality , some from misanthropy , have no wish for the company of their fellows '
p1848
aS' if there was one liberal there might be others , so i looked round the hut in search of them '
p1849
aS' it was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged inadvertently in every nook and corner '
p1850
aS' there were a thousand duels to save , but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night '
p1851
aS' the butler was standing very tall but very collected before us '
p1852
aS' joseph harrison is my name , and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a queen by marriage '
p1853
aS' a coachman and two policemen form the staff of servants '
p1854
aS' he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people , with his filaments stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumor or suspicion of unsolved crime '
p1855
aS' there , sitting together in the pavement , i told holmes of my conversation with the lady '
p1856
aS' as he collected from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance '
p1857
aS' if the former , she had probably traversed the photograph to his keeping '
p1858
aS' then he leant over the hill '
p1859
aS' the chimney is wide , but is higher up by four large staples '
p1860
aS' i trust that i am not more contemptible than my neighbours , but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes '
p1861
aS' the twilight had reined in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished '
p1862
aS' then she swayed open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly '
p1863
aS' but there were famous signs that i had not come upon a false scent '
p1864
aS' your task is offered to that '
p1865
aS' the last red grass had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor '
p1866
aS' i had no hesitation in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed '
p1867
aS" the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure , and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers "
p1868
aS' i have told you now the whole truth , and if i withheld it from the police it is because i did not rejoice then the danger in which my dear friend stood '
p1869
aS' a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he resigned to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket '
p1870
aS' she left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , staring about her approaching wedding '
p1871
aS' we could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in '
p1872
aS' why should she fight against every coast until it was forced from her '
p1873
aS' holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel , and the talk leaped away into less dangerous channels '
p1874
aS" it's not a very large picture , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living "
p1875
aS' you have all the cleverness which makes a plain man '
p1876
aS' the duke , his father , was at one time bought for foreign affairs '
p1877
aS' when it was concluded he settled our new dishes upon the sofa , placed a pillow beneath his head , and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach '
p1878
aS" that is my room at the end of the stairs , and my son's is the one beyond it "
p1879
aS' it is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter '
p1880
aS' i understand that it was on a founded matter that you wished to speak to me '
p1881
aS' my heart is punished already since i have confided my trouble to you '
p1882
aS" i confess that i felt easier in my mind when , after following holmes' example and sinking off my shoes , i found myself inside the bedroom "
p1883
aS' for a moment or two i sat breathless , hardly able to believe my ears '

aS' he was haunted by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the mr. acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary '
p1885
aS' the more formal we made the move the less information we might obtain '
p1886
aS" he dived his arm down to the bottom of the woodlands , and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid , such as children's toys are kept in "
p1887
aS' he was off in one of those useful outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone '
p1888
aS' then he shut himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes '
p1889
aS" i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite gentle , and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves 'hullo' i yelled 'hullo "
p1890
aS' i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the shirt upon myself '
p1891
aS' the chimney is wide , but is softened up by four large staples '
p1892
aS' at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a piece of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met '
p1893
aS' i went up to the house with the moonlight , and saw all that was to be seen '
p1894
aS" i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite rational , and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves 'hullo' i yelled 'hullo "
p1895
aS' it would be a mysterious coroner , indeed , who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work '
p1896
aS' here we dismissed our cab , and made our way up the drive together '
p1897
aS' an hour and half had elapsed before the inspector returned alone '
p1898
aS' i began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener retribution that he did himself '
p1899
aS' as to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to mention whatever expenses i may be put to , at the time which suits you best '
p1900
aS' the photograph is in a fog behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull '
p1901
aS' she had been terribly arrested immediately after his disappearance '
p1902
aS' if she were ill-used , then at any risks i was permitted to go back to her assistance '
p1903
aS' the fat man cast his eyes round , and then up at the open skylight '
p1904
aS' he held in his hand a supply of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures '
p1905
aS' when you resemble your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a number of people '
p1906
aS' but to my astonishment , when i came to look round me , neither house nor garden were to be seen '
p1907
aS' a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three conspirators opened '
p1908
aS' but , you know , i have been trained as an excuse myself '
p1909
aS' he had started blowing swiftly over the moor , and i had followed at his heels '
p1910
aS' he insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he gave me a glance homeward '

aS' i could only check it by promising if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy '
p1912
aS' you can imagine my occupation , watson , when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground '
p1913
aS' we could see the negroes in the wood where it had been pushed in '
p1914
aS' my companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat blown down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought '
p1915
aS' it was a little past six when i frolicked , so i went first to have my wound dressed , and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here '
p1916
aS" as it is , i feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my comforter round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand "
p1917
aS' having done this , he drew up the windows on each side , and i found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to preserve my seeing through them '
p1918
aS' there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the salutary disappearance of the door-key '

aS" my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end "
p1921
aS' when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as formidable as that with which we had started '
p1922
aS' in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the nearest moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears '

aS' it is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a moderate pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent '
p1930
aS' we had reached the same crowded clergy in which we had found ourselves in the morning '
p1931
aS' this we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us in our lives we erected a hydraulic press '
p1932
aS' i could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and grouped in some sort of loose white gown '
p1933
aS' it is not a common note among employers in this age '
p1934
aS' mr. melas is a policeman by extraction , as i understand , and he is a remarkable linguist '
p1935
aS' surely the explanation of all this could not be as loud as she would have me believe '
p1936
aS' all my unspoken instincts , my warmest suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist '
p1937
aS' it would indeed be a companion for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed '
p1938
aS' by it he laid the possibilities of matches and the stump of a candle '
p1939
aS" the house was just such as i had denied it from sherlock holmes' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected "
p1940
aS' i interpret all languages or nearly all but as i am a greek by birth and with a grecian name , it is with that particular belief that i am principally associated '
p1941
aS" i have established a right of way through the centre of old middleton's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yards of his own front door "
p1942
aS" to do this was quite beyond my power , and i could only hope that by torture i might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate "
p1943
aS' he sat at my side in silence all the time , and i was aware , more than once when i glanced in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity '
p1944
aS" the colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa , and a careful examination made of the scene of the tragedy "
p1945
aS' i rushed across the lawn , flung open the window , and looked out '
p1946
aS' it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was startled by the butler and the footman '
p1947
aS" i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay , and i danced with you that he is at the head of his profession "
p1948
aS' the telescope , a revolutionary instrument mounted upon a tripod , stood upon the flat leads of the house '
p1949
aS' holmes walked slowly round and promised each and all of them with the keenest interest '
p1950
aS" holmes's voice hummed as he answered "
p1951
aS' indeed , it was almost pedestrian , the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist , for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek '
p1952
aS' then suddenly he plunged forward , scraped my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my success '
p1953
aS' far away we could hear the deep shadow of the parish clock , which boomed out every quarter of an hour '
p1954
aS' right in front of the house , upon the left-hand side of the drive , there stood a patriarch among engineers , one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen '
p1955
aS' we will be charmed into the sitting-room to wait for the lady , but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph '
p1956
aS' the point is of the utmost exertion as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel '
p1957
aS' within twenty-four hours i was in his sick-room , and was constrained to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms '
p1958
aS' holmes walked slowly , taking keen note of the rays of the house '
p1959
aS" that is his generous fault , but on the whole he's a good worker "
p1960
aS' suddenly , however , an enervating incident opened up quite a new prospect to me '
p1961
aS' four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open '
p1962
aS' i thought the matter over , and i came to the conclusion that i must approach the case from another aspect '
p1963
aS' the bell-rope hangs from the scene just to the right of my desk '
p1964
aS' this also was opened , and led down a flight of winding stone balconies , which terminated at another formidable gate '
p1965
aS' we got off , doubling our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead '
p1966
aS' it is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable business '
p1967
aS' she then called for miss morrison , a young lady who lives in the next villa , and the two went off together to their meeting '
p1968
aS' but i understand , holmes , that you are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to amaze us '
p1969
aS' i rushed out , fluttering loudly for my stepfather , and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown '
p1970
aS' we could see the drops in the wood where it had been pushed in '
p1971
aS' the last red gardener had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor '
p1972
aS' one side of the window was open , which i understand was quite usual in the staircase , and he passed without difficulty into the room '
p1973
aS' he shook hands eagerly with sherlock holmes , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was forced to hear his story '
p1974
aS" it's not a very large affair , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living "
p1975
aS' my friend was an enthusiastic highwayman , being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit '
p1976
aS" the woman's story hung coherently together , and all my senses were unable to shake it "
p1977
aS' that frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins '
p1978
aS' the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed shakily behind us , and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away '
p1979
aS' you will observe that the hour trampled upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate '
p1980
aS" besides , i can read in a man's eye when it is his own hypothesis that he is frightened for "
p1981
aS' the lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was removed to her room , still in a state of insensibility '
p1982
aS' half way down this keyhole is a small landing , with another passage running into it at right angles '
p1983
aS' i am still so weak that i have to rustle , as you see , by dictating '
p1984
aS' mr. melas is a prisoner by extraction , as i understand , and he is a remarkable linguist '
p1985
aS' the man is by trade a conjurer and performer , going round the canteens after nightfall , and giving a little entertainment at each '
p1986
aS' an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the midst of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator '
p1987
aS' across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had transpired during the day '
p1988
aS' it may kiss his gossip '
p1989
aS' holmes took a cup of papers from his pocket '
p1990
aS' the photograph becomes a colder weapon now '
p1991
aS' i determined to wait until i got back to town before holding my story to the police '
p1992
aS' but then , when i found how i had ordered myself , i began to think '
p1993
aS' i knew that it was my gambling voice '
p1994
aS' how he did it i could not move , but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd , and right up to the steps which led to the office '
p1995
aS' suddenly , however , he started , motioning me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows '
p1996
aS' there he is , all blood-stained and sound '
p1997
aS' when a wagon does go wrong he is the first of criminals '
p1998
aS' as a rule , when i have heard some fashionable indication of the course of events , i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory '
p1999
aS' it was an old tartan door and gave at once before our united strength '
p2000
aS' your task is refreshing to that '
p2001
aS' why should she fight against every job until it was forced from her '
p2002
aS' as to the photograph , your opinion may rest in peace '
p2003
aS' i fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and invested it '
p2004
aS' it was nearly accumulated between the oak and the house '
p2005
aS' it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire , and within seven miles of reading '
p2006
aS' having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary dinner-party , to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon '
p2007
aS' he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her '
p2008
aS' to me at least there was a strange confusion between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged '
p2009
aS' mortimer had risen to dinner , and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards '
p2010
aS' my submission abused him and led him to further confidences '
p2011
aS' it was a homely little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old country-houses '
p2012
aS' i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it , but there came a sudden sob in my ears , and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes '
p2013
aS' the boy was nowhere to be seen '
p2014
aS' then , when i recall a light upon them , close in swiftly '
p2015
aS' suddenly a door opened at the other end of the lawn , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction '
p2016
aS" the house was just such as i had touched it from sherlock holmes' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected "
p2017
aS' i should not go too far if i were to say that there was a general experience at that time that a distinguished career lay before me '
p2018
aS' it told how two voices who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end '
p2019
aS' this we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press '
p2020
aS' i handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and danced for some time in silence '
p2021
aS' would she not have made an imaginary queen '
p2022
aS' he was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the epithets of his emotion '
p2023
aS' there he is , all safe and sound '
p2024
aS' within was a small , noble room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time '
p2025
aS' i made excellent appetites , and they are only delayed one day upon their way '
p2026
aS' these were all throbbings which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter '
p2027
aS' i should not wish a smarter foe , mr. holmes ; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him '
p2028
aS' once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission '
p2029
aS' the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed '
p2030
aS' if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised '
p2031
aS' it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly conceal some traces of this mysterious individual '
p2032
aS' the king landed at him in amazement '
p2033
aS' the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston , and it comes down with the force of many scores upon this metal floor '
p2034
aS' he had usually a great many letters , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him '
p2035
aS' the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which i had the privilege of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods '
p2036
aS' on the last occasion he had believed that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also '
p2037
aS' the back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the parties he saw two men wrestling together outside '
p2038
aS' matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the original mystery '
p2039
aS' it would be a contemptible coroner , indeed , who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work '
p2040
aS' he was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable discretion and vindictiveness '
p2041
aS' now , there is no one more easy to improve than a schoolmaster '
p2042
aS' it was a mere past six when we left baker street , and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue '
p2043
aS' i want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be defeated away '
p2044
aS' this , of course , fitted in well enough with the mystic theory , if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him '
p2045
aS' it must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself '
p2046
aS' in an instant it was persuaded that we had at last come upon the true place , and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently '
p2047
aS' as we walked home together , holmes stopped at a telegraph office and sent off several wires '
p2048
aS' i am only , of course , giving you the leading officers now of my examination of the paper '
p2049
aS' joseph harrison is my name , and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a penitent by marriage '
p2050
aS' sherlock holmes had listened to this long narrative with an emphasis which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused '
p2051
aS' we all sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative '
p2052
aS' yet , with all this , you made me sustain what you wanted to know '
p2053
aS" we had reached pall mall as we reeled , and were walking down it from the st. james's end "
p2054
aS" he's in wedlock , too , but he's not a convict as far as i can make out "
p2055
aS' he looked round him with a calm and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit '
p2056
aS' my companion let down the window , and i caught a glimpse of a low , marshy doorway with a lamp burning above it '
p2057
aS' the j. p shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own abilities , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room '
p2058
aS' his eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he staggered on his face upon the ground '
p2059
aS' he was unable , however , to make his way in , and the angels were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him '
p2060
aS' but the evening has brought a dynamo with it '
p2061
aS' the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was delighted to apoplexy '
p2062
aS' i really had not the energy to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion , but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation '
p2063
aS" i don't think i ever choked faster , but the others were there before us "
p2064
aS' i saw in the gaslight that holmes smote an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine '
p2065
aS' i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it , but there came a sudden flash in my ears , and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes '
p2066
aS' i really had not the aeroplane to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion , but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation '
p2067
aS' presently he emerged , looking even more unprofitable than before '
p2068
aS' i could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and bathed in some sort of loose white gown '
p2069
aS' but i want to find out about them , and who they are , and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me '
p2070
aS' the rapidity with which such a saint would take effect would also , from his point of view , be an advantage '
p2071
aS' the wound upon the dead man was , as i was able to determine with absolute confidence , fired from a carafe at the distance of something over four yards '
p2072
aS" at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she paused at the door and looked back "
p2073
aS' i made excellent coffee , and they are only delayed one day upon their way '
p2074
aS' within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very hot iron gate '
p2075
aS' his eyes looked malignantly at me , and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat '
p2076
aS" i went at once to my room and drew up my resolution of the morning's conversation for holmes "
p2077
aS' besides , remember that she had written to use it within a few days '
p2078
aS' i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my tongue when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell '
p2079
aS" to do this was quite beyond my power , and i could only hope that by economy i might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate "
p2080
aS' i clambered out upon the sill , but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who allowed me '
p2081
aS' for half an hour i sat with extended ears '
p2082
aS' such an excursion could not be kept secret '
p2083
aS' they were all three standing in a drawing-room in front of the altar '
p2084
aS' it threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall '
p2085
aS' it was a delicate point , and it guarded the field of my inquiry '
p2086
aS' in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket , and dropped my stick while i was chasing teddy , who had run up the curtain '
p2087
aS' the proceedings against the page broke down for want of inquest , and the brook street mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print '
p2088
aS' i had myself extinguished the lamp and rang the door before coming to bed '
p2089
aS' she left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , gazing about her approaching wedding '
p2090
aS" i have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and i think i'll overhaul them in you "
p2091
aS' but the inspector was mistaken , for those criminals were not sufficient to fall into the hands of justice '
p2092
aS" let me pass , i say' he gathered her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon "
p2093
aS' he had usually a great many snares , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him '
p2094
aS' i thought the matter over , and i came to the conclusion that i must strike the case from another aspect '
p2095
aS' when i went upstairs with him he pointed to several footprints upon the light carpet '
p2096
aS' two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just at the stroke of eleven , a single bright light shone out right in front of us '
p2097
aS' naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook , and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the element which was still raging '
p2098
aS' together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united liaison would suffice to raise the stone '
p2099
aS' far away stretched a line of houses , with a light here and there in the upper windows '
p2100
aS" if my hair would only change colour , here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into "
p2101
aS' this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by valor , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street '
p2102
aS' you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your lonely days then '
p2103
aS' with an apology for my intrusion , i was about to attack when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me '
p2104
aS' it had set , according to their account , into the most tender expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming '
p2105
aS' we stepped , as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that i failed to catch the most courteous glance of the front of the house '
p2106
aS' there was something that touched me as i read this letter , something naked in the reiterated appeals to bring holmes '
p2107
aS' it was evident that a nurse or strong knife had been thrust in , and the lock forced back with it '
p2108
aS' and into her lap , which was the very room which i suspected '
p2109
aS' a few faint tragedies were gleaming in a violet sky '
p2110
aS' i began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener shingles that he did himself '
p2111
aS' there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions , which contrasted with my former experiences '
p2112
aS' a greek friend had come to see him upon business , he said , and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue , the services of an orchestra were indispensable '
p2113
aS' there were several people on the news at the time , but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by '
p2114
aS' suddenly , however , an ingenious incident opened up quite a new prospect to me '
p2115
aS' more than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so narrow was the effect '
p2116
aS" too large for easy familiarity about a woman's dress "
p2117
aS" therefore something had occurred between fifty and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him "
p2118
aS" the smarting of it ends in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure , and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers "
p2119
aS' i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an illness , and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work '
p2120
aS' it was worth an effort to find out , and for that ridge we all went up to the house '
p2121
aS' i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of centers by studying their children '
p2122
aS' holmes took a member of papers from his pocket '
p2123
aS' it was absolutely certain , therefore , in spite of her honour , that she must know something of the matter '
p2124
aS' my coffee had not yet come , and i wondered what was the cause of the surroundings could be '
p2125
aS' nothing would induce me to help the loch in any way '
p2126
aS' his clothes , his watch , and even his money were in his room , but the black circumstance which he usually wore was missing '
p2127
aS' i told the police last time they did it that they should hire these disgraceful exhibitions '
p2128
aS' his grandfather was a royal concubine , and he himself has been to eton and oxford '
p2129
aS' you must lock yourself up from him to-night '
p2130
aS" there's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was hanged for it "
p2131
aS' he and i seemed to be the only living things between the judicial arch of the sky and the desert beneath it '
p2132
aS' the manor-house is , as i have already said , very old , and only one object is now inhabited '
p2133
aS' i should like to have his prospect of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done '
p2134
aS' i am a brave man to fall foul of '
p2135
aS' i assure you , sir henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to relieve america '
p2136
aS' it had wandered on to the dirt and had never come back '
p2137
aS' if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how patiently you are compromised '
p2138
aS' the stage lost a fine hunter , even as science lost an acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in crime '
p2139
aS' once or twice we drifted into talk , and i can remember that more than once he owned a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference '
p2140
aS' i rushed gently from the room on to the landing '
p2141
aS' the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we landed and jolted terribly '
p2142
aS' as i gave a last hurried glance around , i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward '
p2143
aS' twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting elsewhere for whatever might befall '
p2144
aS" i was feeling cynical and stupid , partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day's work "
p2145
aS' the woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the reckless light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face '
p2146
aS' you remember the small bunches of uriah and bathsheba '
p2147
aS' if there was one report there might be others , so i looked round the hut in search of them '
p2148
aS' if you leave , you spent your whole position forever '
p2149
aS' the chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as i glanced across it told me of its richness '
p2150
aS' surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe '
p2151
aS' they have given up the pavements there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him '
p2152
aS' the law is upon his side , and every day i am enchanted by the possibility that he may force me to live with him '
p2153
aS' altogether there are eight maids , the velocity , the butler , two footmen , and a boy '
p2154
aS' then suddenly another sound became fixed a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle '
p2155
aS' i had no objection to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs. lyons upon the evening before , for dr. mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late '
p2156
aS' mr. alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man , and so the baby got clean away '
p2157
aS' what is the proportion of it all '
p2158
aS' having once made up my mind , you know the correspondence which i took in order to put the matter to the proof '
p2159
aS' suddenly a door opened at the other end of the stream , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction '
p2160
aS' we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the image of a hound , and then a scream of agony , with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to '
p2161
aS' the boy was condemned to be seen '
p2162
aS' sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion , but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor '
p2163
aS' you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his conscience bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed '
p2164
aS' the shutters cut off the least piece of light , and we waited in absolute darkness '
p2165
aS' peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which dangled from a small brass tripod in the centre '
p2166
aS' the thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains '
p2167
aS' mr. alec , however , was a sensible man to play games of that sort with '
p2168
aS' all day today the rain poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves '
p2169
aS' he was enforced by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the mr. acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary '
p2170
aS' as we ran towards it the vague outline folded into a definite shape '
p2171
aS' the sight of the safe , the saucer of milk , and the rights of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained '
p2172
aS' i have already shouted what is to occur '
p2173
aS' but not one word shall they have from me , and i join you to secrecy also , dr. watson '
p2174
aS' there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the secretive disappearance of the door-key '
p2175
aS' everything was born in my favour , and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way '
p2176
aS' then suddenly he plunged forward , ate my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my success '
p2177
aS' it will end in my being conveyed into the house '
p2178
aS' we compress the earth into bricks , so as to remove them without revealing what they are '
p2179
aS' the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants , and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness '
p2180
aS' she writhed as one who is in terrible consequences , and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed '
p2181
aS' i should like , however , to understand a little more successfully what it is that you wish me to do '
p2182
aS' i stood dumb with astonishment , watching him from the darkness '
p2183
aS' this press , as i have already gathered , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject '
p2184
aS' you are to ask the questions , mr. melas , and he will spoil the answers '
p2185
aS' he hammered loudly at the tumult and pulled at the bell , but without any success '
p2186
aS' i noticed her pass , but i had no special reason for understanding her '
p2187
aS' but to my ignorance , when i came to look round me , neither house nor garden were to be seen '
p2188
aS' he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells , and then would accompany her as his accomplice '
p2189
aS' an hour and half had arrived before the inspector returned alone '
p2190
aS" don't you see that the converse is equally valid "
p2191
aS' fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have encumbered the gossips away from this four-year-old drama '
p2192
aS' together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united vices would suffice to raise the stone '
p2193
aS' you will observe that the hour resounded upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate '
p2194
aS' the maid had loved the automobiles , but had afterwards had cause to hate him '
p2195
aS" it hadn't pulled up before she threw out of the hall door and into it "
p2196
aS' the paper over each window was wonderful to light , and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front '
p2197
aS" i was still rather tight over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind "
p2198
aS' a maid dwelt across and threw open the window '
p2199
aS' surely the explanation of all this could not be as tough as she would have me believe '
p2200
aS' he was very willing to have a holiday , so we changed the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement '
p2201
aS' she listened for an instant , packed up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come '
p2202
aS' during two years i have had three jackets and one small job , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me '
p2203
aS' it may prove the simplest matter in the world , but all the same at first glance this is just a little taller , is it not '
p2204
aS' come , now , we shall see who wrought with you '
p2205
aS' they meet , they write , there is a complete understanding between them '
p2206
aS' was she his client , his friend , or his mistress '
p2207
aS' i rose , and , making my society , escaped from the house '
p2208
aS' the policeman and i agreed that our best plan would be to disobey the woman before she could get rid of the papers , presuming that she had them '
p2209
aS' if you leave , you murder your whole position forever '
p2210
aS' that was bad enough , for all that the coroner said '
p2211
aS' and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter , the possibility of which is still involved in some mystery '
p2212
aS' now , on the other side of this primitive wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open '
p2213
aS' a maid slept across and threw open the window '
p2214
aS' then i carefully wiped off five to the east and two to the south '
p2215
aS' it may be that the solution of the one may forget to be the solution of the other '
p2216
aS' and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and reveal his interest '
p2217
aS' he was off like a shot and got clean away '
p2218
aS' i made no allusion to what had passed , and watered with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace '
p2219
aS' but now your thoughts went back to beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were boarding the character in his features '
p2220
aS' the woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the fiercest light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face '
p2221
aS' he had a very dark , colorless face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams '
p2222
aS' one other detail of interest was repelled by jane stewart , the housemaid '
p2223
aS' i say normal cases , because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the offspring of old age , even when the invalid is a youth '
p2224
aS' again and again i have taken a problem to him , and have received an invitation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one '
p2225
aS' it gave even my familiar nerves a shudder to look at it '
p2226
aS' besides , i knew that my mistress was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up '
p2227
aS' they inherit second-rate blood by direct descent , and tudor on the distaff side '
p2228
aS' i sprang up and faced the lamp , but nothing was to be seen in the room '
p2229
aS' i sprang up and examined the lamp , but nothing was to be seen in the room '
p2230
aS' he came himself to live with me in the character of a prompt patient '
p2231
aS' in an instant his strange headgear began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent '
p2232
aS' within was a small , haunted room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time '
p2233
aS" when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the shadows at st. james's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down "
p2234
aS' there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to omit the bar '
p2235
aS' i would never wear a banker , mr. holmes '
p2236
aS' i saw in the gaslight that holmes imparted an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine '
p2237
aS' out of this landing opened the night-gown and several bedrooms , including those of mr. cunningham and his son '
p2238
aS' pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is not perfectly clear to you '
p2239
aS" therefore something had occurred between bombay and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him "
p2240
aS' for all they cared it might have been me , instead of my childhood , which these rascals burned at the stake '
p2241
aS' i suppose there would be no chance of a pace back '
p2242
aS' in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket , and dipped my stick while i was chasing teddy , who had run up the curtain '
p2243
aS' i have made a small herd of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject '
p2244
aS' miss irene , or madame , rather , stirred from her drive at seven '
p2245
aS' he took a small piece of torn paper from a flag and spread it out upon his knee '
p2246
aS' yet it was quite certain , from the whizzing stillness , that we were in the country '
p2247
aS' it was not until we had reached home that i began to realize the true state of affairs '
p2248
aS' he started me off upon the letter a , and then he left me ; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me '
p2249
aS' i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman troubled by the table '
p2250
aS' it rained hard this afternoon , as you know , and my patients were the only people who called '
p2251
aS" don't you dare to dance with my affairs "
p2252
aS' she knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the handle , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside '
p2253
aS' we have provided him with all that he can want '
p2254
aS' i keep it only to compromise myself , and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future '
p2255
aS' his chin was sheathed upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful , rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling '
p2256
aS' i slept at baker street that night , and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room '
p2257
aS' for a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical organization in my calculations '
p2258
aS' all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years , are eligible '
p2259
aS' this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by universities , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street '
p2260
aS' until after the labours of fire , i had not a suspicion '
p2261
aS' i have tried to fling it from the measurements '
p2262
aS' my sister and i , you will recollect , were twins , and you know how violent are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied '
p2263
aS' suddenly , however , an unhealthy incident opened up quite a new prospect to me '
p2264
aS' in a period of anger , however , caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house , he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence '
p2265
aS' at last she looked up with something solid and defiant in her manner '
p2266
aS' suddenly , however , as i ran , a sturdy dizziness and sickness came over me '
p2267
aS' we compress the earth into bricks , so as to remove them without discussing what they are '
p2268
aS' i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my fork when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell '
p2269
aS' thrust it into his pocket , most likely , never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the habit of the corpse '
p2270
aS' palmer and pritchard were among the penalties of their profession '
p2271
aS' the policeman and i agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she could get rid of the papers , presuming that she had them '
p2272
aS' it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust , and damp and worms had eaten through the wood , so that a crop of livid fungi was sleeping on the inside of it '
p2273
aS' the proceedings against the page broke down for want of suspicions , and the brook street mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print '
p2274
aS' it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it '
p2275
aS' between ourselves , i think mr. holmes had not quite got over his grave yet '
p2276
aS' the lawn is thirty yards across , and is only divided from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it '
p2277
aS' it is your commonplace , inevitable crimes which are really puzzling , just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify '
p2278
aS' the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit swallowed about into every corner of the room '
p2279
aS' you are to ask the questions , mr. melas , and he will arouse the answers '
p2280
aS" he was tractable enough , though his son was a perfect lad , ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver "
p2281
aS' finally he walked over to the bed and offered some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall '
p2282
aS' it had wandered on to the moor and had never come back '
p2283
aS' this we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us in our situation we erected a hydraulic press '
p2284
aS' sherlock holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the carlton , and , cautioning me not to speak , he led the way into the hall '
p2285
aS' she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead , and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs '
p2286
aS' again and again i liked her , but i could never get past that point '
p2287
aS' here we cudgeled our cab , and made our way up the drive together '
p2288
aS' i was a happy and successful man , mr. holmes , and on the eve of being married , when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all my prospects in life '
p2289
aS' so tall was he that his hat urgently brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side '
p2290
aS' she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to bungle the last trace of her crime '
p2291
aS' a ventilator is made , a choice is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies '
p2292
aS' it was several miles off , but i could darkly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray '
p2293
aS' everything which had been disconnected before began at once to supplement its true place , and i had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events '
p2294
aS' i beg you to remember that no one knows where you are , and that , whether you are in this carriage or in my house , you are interested in my power '
p2295
aS' you see that we hold all the cards , and we have only to fear some sudden act of charity on their part '
p2296
aS' then sherlock holmes peered down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings '
p2297
aS' it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part '
p2298
aS' for three hours we strolled about together , filling the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand '
p2299
aS' i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery '
p2300
aS' i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the highways and down a winding stair '
p2301
aS' her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well '
p2302
aS' the duke , his father , was at one time confused for foreign affairs '
p2303
aS' all day today the acorns poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves '
p2304
aS' i sat down upon a sword in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over '
p2305
aS' at first he was very eager to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better '
p2306
aS' her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his friendship and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well '
p2307
aS' it was one of the main arteries which contained the traffic of the city to the north and west '
p2308
aS' it was a sweet thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody '
p2309
aS" at first i thought that she had not touched me , but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget , 'oh , my god "
p2310
aS' the wound upon the dead man was , as i was able to determine with absolute confidence , fired from a cushion at the distance of something over four yards '
p2311
aS' the wind was howling outside , and the rain was beating and staggering against the windows '
p2312
aS' i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the valleys and down a winding stair '
p2313
aS' there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is reduced to you '
p2314
aS' you must judge yourself up from him to-night '
p2315
aS' he said a few words to each candidate as he came up , and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would mock them '
p2316
aS' you can hardly realize , then , how thankful i found it at first , and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway '
p2317
aS' this girl had been devoted to him '
p2318
aS' there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is entrusted to you '
p2319
aS' it gave even my long-standing nerves a shudder to look at it '
p2320
aS' i know something , sir henry , and perhaps i should have said it before , but it was long after the books that i found it out '
p2321
aS' nothing would induce me to help the police in any way '
p2322
aS' besides this practical outlay , he must be prepared to keep himself for some years , and to hire a presentable carriage and horse '
p2323
aS" he was tractable enough , though his son was a perfect priest , ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver "
p2324
aS' the air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth '
p2325
aS' but here an unexpected and singular history presented itself '
p2326
aS' otherwise your energy and attention must be helped instead of being concentrated '
p2327
aS' the walls were of wood , but the floor consisted of a large iron trough , and when i came to examine it i could see a couple of metallic deposit all over it '
p2328
aS' i will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these sights and let me have whatever bears upon the matter '
p2329
aS' outside the sun was running low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold '
p2330
aS' i act differently from a sense of public duty '
p2331
aS' i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it , but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears , and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes '
p2332
aS' ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again i marked my spot with a peg '
p2333
aS' for that matter , reading , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all '
p2334
aS' but that is a longish detail '
p2335
aS' his secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to forget it '
p2336
aS' it cost me something in foolscap , and i had pretty nearly filled a level with my writings '
p2337
aS' half way down this theory is a small landing , with another passage running into it at right angles '
p2338
aS' far away we could hear the deep breathing of the parish clock , which boomed out every quarter of an hour '
p2339
aS' he used to make merry over the cleverness of women , but i have not heard him do it of late '
p2340
aS' with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose , i sat in the dark recess of the hut and breakfasted with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant '
p2341
aS' i observe that there is a good deal of german arguments on the programme , which is rather more to my taste than italian or french '
p2342
aS' peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which flickered from a small brass tripod in the centre '
p2343
aS' the butler was standing very accurately but very collected before us '
p2344
aS' he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone '
p2345
aS' the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which i had the magnitude of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods '
p2346
aS' at waterloo we were fortunate in accepting a train for leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes '
p2347
aS' he took a small piece of torn paper from a pencil and spread it out upon his knee '
p2348
aS' palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession '
p2349
aS" i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a younger man a man who might play a deep game "
p2350
aS' for myself , my term of service in india had invited me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship '
p2351
aS' the younger had left us , but he suddenly returned through another door , leading with him a gentleman born in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us '
p2352
aS' at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met '
p2353
aS' as i gave a last contemptuous glance around , i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward '
p2354
aS' it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money , and that it is still prevalent in our cellar '
p2355
aS' i knew that it was my mightier voice '
p2356
aS' having done this , he drew up the windows on each side , and i found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to justify my seeing through them '
p2357
aS" at first i thought that she had not regarded me , but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget , 'oh , my god "
p2358
aS' after throwing down your paper , which was the residue which drew my attention to you , you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression '
p2359
aS' the light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the sunshine came a reedy , quivering voice '
p2360
aS' then i put out my hand and was about to shake the man , who was still snowing soundly , when a bell over his head rang loudly , and he woke with a start '
p2361
aS' but i want to find out about them , and who they are , and what their territory was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me '
p2362
aS' i heard that barclay had married nancy , and that he was strolling rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak '
p2363
aS" to rake this up couldn't help our poor master , and it's well to go yesterday when there's a lady in the case "
p2364
aS' the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston , and it comes down with the force of many thousands upon this metal floor '
p2365
aS' suddenly , however , he started , tapped me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows '
p2366
aS' his eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he rode on his face upon the ground '
p2367
aS' i thought the matter over , and i came to the conclusion that i must burn the case from another aspect '
p2368
aS' we had come out upon oxford street and i had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to kensington , when my words were arrested by the extraordinary conduct of my companion '
p2369
aS' a young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich spoils of the garden and the balmy summer air '
p2370
aS' mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair , with his forefinger upon the paper , but his eyes upon my companion '
p2371
aS' she left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , chatting about her approaching wedding '
p2372
aS' it is a little place near the balance of oxfordshire , and within seven miles of reading '
p2373
aS" i was feeling lonely and stupid , partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day's work "
p2374
aS' i interpret all languages or nearly all but as i am a greek by birth and with a grecian name , it is with that particular dream that i am principally associated '
p2375
aS' but he will never trouble essays in this country again '
p2376
aS" too large for easy conversation about a woman's dress "
p2377
aS' the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat '
p2378
aS' he was not remarkable for intelligence , and his answers were frequently motionless , which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language '
p2379
aS' if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving blanks for the other to fill up '
p2380
aS' it is impossible that you may even have read some account of the matter '
p2381
aS' joseph harrison is my name , and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a relation by marriage '
p2382
aS' for many years i have been the chief greek valise in london , and my name is very well known in the hotels '
p2383
aS' the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room '
p2384
aS' of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim '
p2385
aS' then he did the same with the ceiling with which the chamber was panelled '
p2386
aS' we even preceded them as far as reading , but could get no farther , for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands '
p2387
aS' the least appearance of co-operation struck fire out of the old autocrat '
p2388
aS' holmes had slanted away , but he came back in a few minutes '
p2389
aS' but , you know , i have been trained as an elephant myself '
p2390
aS' we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france '
p2391
aS' twice he struck at the chamber door without any praise from within '
p2392
aS' i lounged up the side aisle like any other emperor who has dropped into a church '
p2393
aS' it is a perfectly overpowering misdemeanour , and i have more than once taken advantage of it '
p2394
aS' when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals '
p2395
aS' the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit bristled about into every corner of the room '
p2396
aS' i have already sneered what is to occur '
p2397
aS' i shall stand behind this crate , and do you conceal yourselves behind those '
p2398
aS' they meet , they write , there is a complete repose between them '
p2399
aS' it may be that the solution of the one may learn to be the solution of the other '
p2400
aS' his brain is as loud as his fingers , and though we meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to find the man himself '
p2401
aS' i read death on his face as plain as i can read that tube over the fire '
p2402
aS' but the girl held true to me , and it seemed that i would have had her when the mutiny broke out , and all hell was loose in the country '
p2403
aS' the photograph is in a field behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull '
p2404
aS' then , when i flash a light upon them , close in swiftly '
p2405
aS' during my dreams i had been intimately associated with a lad named percy phelps , who was of much the same age as myself , though he was two classes ahead of me '
p2406
aS' the thieves ruled the library and got very little for their pains '
p2407
aS' now , of course that effected at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms '
p2408
aS' together we whirled into the room '
p2409
aS' in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the polished moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears '
p2410
aS' the money which my mother had left was enough for all our hunger , and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness '
p2411
aS' what is the meaning of it all '
p2412
aS' he laughed very heartily , with a high , simpering note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides '
p2413
aS' the house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty pence from the high-road '
p2414
aS' he laughed very heartily , with a high , tender note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides '
p2415
aS' i implored the design to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries '
p2416
aS' the barren scene , the sense of loneliness , and the hammer and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart '
p2417
aS' and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and visit his interest '
p2418
aS' she married an artist named lyons , who came sketching on the moor '
p2419
aS' it is most eminently unusual '
p2420
aS' possibly i had taken no degree since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported '
p2421
aS' the twilight had swelled in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished '
p2422
aS' he carries some doubts about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it '
p2423
aS' of course he must obey the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim '
p2424
aS" he's in hiding , too , but he's not a convict as far as i can make out "
p2425
aS' as i descended , my old ally , the moon , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him '
p2426
aS" a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love , however badly he may have treated her "
p2427
aS' with much labour we separated them and carried him , living but horribly good-natured , into the house '
p2428
aS' we are but humiliating her from injuring another '
p2429
aS' but there were written signs that i had not come upon a false scent '
p2430
aS' then he did the same with the rowers with which the chamber was panelled '
p2431
aS' it was a cloudy day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens '
p2432
aS' he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells , and then would engage her as his accomplice '
p2433
aS' a meeting of the guild had been held that evening at eight , and mrs. barclay had prevailed over her dinner in order to be present at it '
p2434
aS' my stepfather has earned no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring '
p2435
aS' the letter had , as i said , been born and it was not all legible '
p2436
aS' the smoke and packages were enough to shake nerves of steel '
p2437
aS' mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair , with his tobacco upon the paper , but his eyes upon my companion '
p2438
aS' sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long nights and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon '
p2439
aS' nor would it be entirely covered with most of the words overhead '
p2440
aS' i have made a small bag of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject '
p2441
aS' still , of course , if you would like to hang out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so '
p2442
aS' it was evident that a lord or strong knife had been thrust in , and the lock forced back with it '
p2443
aS' major murphy , to whom i owe most of my facts , assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair '
p2444
aS' holmes had sat up upon the couch , and i saw him grinning like a man who is in need of air '
p2445
aS' of course he must lead the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim '
p2446
aS' if i lay on my face the enemy would come upon my spine , and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap '
p2447
aS' yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural instinct , and due to no disease , for his eye was bright , his step brisk , and his bearing assured '
p2448
aS' sherlock holmes had listened to this long narrative with an dissimulation which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused '
p2449
aS' it was a gray day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens '
p2450
aS' i should not be very much freer if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair '
p2451
aS' at first he was very rude to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better '
p2452
aS' holmes dashed into the crowd to replace the lady ; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his face '
p2453
aS' half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes '
p2454
aS' i am a light sleeper , and it has treated me '
p2455
aS' he is a bit of a don juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very tender part to play in a quiet country district '
p2456
aS' a terrible scream a drowsy yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor '
p2457
aS' once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be sprinkled across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission '
p2458
aS' it was a wonderfully silent house '
p2459
aS' such an artist could not be kept secret '
p2460
aS' they have given up the chimney there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him '
p2461
aS' they saw that i must know all about it , you see , and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate '
p2462
aS' i was conscious of a dull pain , my grip loosened , and i fell into the garden below '
p2463
aS' you , of course , saw that mechanism in the street was an accomplice '
p2464
aS' i have no doubt at all that a family ghost can be traced in these two specimens of writing '
p2465
aS' it will give him the concern for which he has been seeking '
p2466
aS' he has sneered and he has knowledge '
p2467
aS' then it flowed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it '
p2468
aS' add to that the length of neck and head , and you get a hymn not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail '
p2469
aS' what is to me a means of transport is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante '
p2470
aS' he had heard nothing , and the challenge remained a complete mystery '
p2471
aS' he was plainly but neatly neglected , and his age , i should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty '
p2472
aS" sorry to see that you've had the british workman in the house "
p2473
aS' i told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions '
p2474
aS' an hour and half had glittered before the inspector returned alone '
p2475
aS' the incidents of the next few days are doubtless graven upon my recollection , and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time '
p2476
aS' i have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing '
p2477
aS' while there she had met a young man named harold latimer , who had acquired an ascendancy over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him '
p2478
aS' together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united inquiry would suffice to raise the stone '
p2479
aS' i trust that i am not more powerful than my neighbours , but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes '
p2480
aS' then mr. alec ran out and skipped beside the wounded man '
p2481
aS' one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is examined into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic '
p2482
aS' he might slip away from us in the crowd of regent street , but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor '
p2483
aS' as it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a nobler and disappointed man '
p2484
aS' the shutters cut off the least shade of light , and we waited in absolute darkness '
p2485
aS' why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her '
p2486
aS' the bell-rope hangs from the hill just to the right of my desk '
p2487
aS' he has been very impatient to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on '
p2488
aS' it is inevitable that you may even have read some account of the matter '
p2489
aS' i stooped under the rude lintel , and there he sat upon a field outside , his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features '
p2490
aS' the twilight had perished in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished '
p2491
aS' it had been stifled or torn right out from the roots '
p2492
aS' luck had been against us again and again in this hall , but now at last it came to my aid '
p2493
aS' already i was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart '
p2494
aS' and into her list , which was the very room which i suspected '
p2495
aS' of course , if they had been merely after breakfast they would at least have made some attempt to search for it '
p2496
aS' at one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the departure of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock '
p2497
aS' even after i became suspicious , i found it hard to think evil of such a dear , kind old clergyman '
p2498
aS' it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have stumped your curiosity '
p2499
aS' he was deadly pale and terribly impromptu , with the protruding , brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength '
p2500
aS' mr. cunningham had just got into bed , and mr. alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown '
p2501
aS" let me pass , i say' he bade her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon "
p2502
aS" besides , i can read in a man's eye when it is his own foreboding that he is frightened for "
p2503
aS' his face set hard , and a baleful light tiptoed up in his grey eyes '
p2504
aS' who were these german people , and what were they doing living in this strange , unladylike place '
p2505
aS' but now your thoughts went back to beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were dismissing the character in his features '
p2506
aS' twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within '
p2507
aS' my mistress told me that you were likely to call '
p2508
aS' but there is , if you will satisfy my saying so , something just a little funny about it '
p2509
aS' i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour , so i swam patiently until he should come round to it '
p2510
aS' once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be walking across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission '
p2511
aS' mr. cunningham , looking out of his danger , saw the fellow as he gained the road , but lost sight of him at once '
p2512
aS" for years i've been dreaming of the bright green twigs and the hedges of england "
p2513
aS' miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him , but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him '
p2514
aS' neither address nor honesty is attached to it '
p2515
aS' in my inmost heart i believed that i could lie where others failed , and now i had the opportunity to test myself '
p2516
aS' holmes waved away the asylum , though his smile showed that it had pleased him '
p2517
aS' have your tea ready in case we should need it '
p2518
aS' a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him '
p2519
aS" i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine' he took a step backward , cocked his head on one side , and shivered at my hair until i felt quite bashful "
p2520
aS' and your godmother had been given me '
p2521
aS' when i thought of the heavy step and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode '
p2522
aS' i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a cypher , go where he might '
p2523
aS' when leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to detach him that she would be back before very long '
p2524
aS' my companion let down the window , and i caught a glimpse of a low , winding doorway with a lamp burning above it '
p2525
aS' he may have been asleep , or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out '
p2526
aS' it was a regular little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old country-houses '
p2527
aS' i dressed hurriedly , for i knew by experience that railway trials were seldom trivial , and hastened downstairs '
p2528
aS' it may stop his gossip '
p2529
aS' as he issued from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance '
p2530
aS' with an apology for my intrusion , i was about to strike when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me '
p2531
aS' we found holmes pacing up and down in the field , his chin sunk upon his breast , and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets '
p2532
aS' all my unspoken instincts , my blind suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist '
p2533
aS' my heart cruised within me as i saw it '
p2534
aS' i made no allusion to what had passed , and encircled with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace '
p2535
aS' she writhed as one who is in terrible danger , and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed '
p2536
aS" a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love , however badly he may have relieved her "
p2537
aS' what is to me a means of eating is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante '
p2538
aS' we took no permission to hide it '
p2539
aS" but i see that the enemy's bullets have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light "
p2540
aS" one morning , at a little before seven o'clock , i was protected by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room "
p2541
aS' we even disabled them as far as reading , but could get no farther , for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands '
p2542
aS' he held up a piece of white cardboard about the tendency of a sheet of note-paper '
p2543
aS' before entering , holmes made an examination of the door which had been forced '
p2544
aS' an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the style of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator '
p2545
aS' holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is supported by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road '
p2546
aS' we should not have troubled you , only that our friend who speaks greek and who began these spurs has been forced to return to the east '
p2547
aS' my heart is soaring already since i have confided my trouble to you '
p2548
aS' the boards round and the merits of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house '
p2549
aS' it was nearly determined between the oak and the house '
p2550
aS' i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you '
p2551
aS' besides , we must be hungry , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits '
p2552
aS' it did wonders both in the crimea and the mutiny , and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion '
p2553
aS' with an apology for my intrusion , i was about to sing when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me '
p2554
aS' my companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat closed down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought '
p2555
aS' sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn '
p2556
aS' the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth '
p2557
aS' i realized it as i sailed back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people '
p2558
aS' sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in digging a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn '
p2559
aS" too large for easy confidences about a woman's dress "
p2560
aS' on his evidence cartwright was confused and the other three got fifteen years apiece '
p2561
aS' on the other hand , we brought to the surface an inkling of a most unexpected kind '
p2562
aS' more than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so eager was the effect '
p2563
aS' his life was bewitched , but in one respect he was regularity itself '
p2564
aS' all was exactly as i left it , save only that the papers which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay '
p2565
aS' the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes '
p2566
aS' it was nearly mentioned between the oak and the house '
p2567
aS' the point under discussion was , how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his pride and how far to his own early training '
p2568
aS' twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting intermittently for whatever might befall '
p2569
aS' a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he sought to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket '
p2570
aS' all you have to do is just to blow out your chair in the consulting-room '
p2571
aS' the maid had loved the porch , but had afterwards had cause to hate him '
p2572
aS' he might slip away from us in the history of regent street , but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor '
p2573
aS' i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but the coachman had come in , and as he was coaxing me narrowly it seemed safer to wait '
p2574
aS' and , first , one or two campaigns , mr. wilson '
p2575
aS' i took out my finger and laid it on the corner of the table '
p2576
aS' the maid had loved the yam , but had afterwards had cause to hate him '
p2577
aS' all you have to do is just to pick out your chair in the consulting-room '
p2578
aS' we were in time to deluge the major before he reached the corner '
p2579
aS' my companion let down the window , and i caught a glimpse of a low , placid doorway with a lamp burning above it '
p2580
aS' then , again , i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red , or dark red , or anything but real bright , infirm , fiery red '
p2581
aS' we had come out upon oxford street and i had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to kensington , when my words were startled by the extraordinary conduct of my companion '
p2582
aS' when i went upstairs with him he pointed to several trenches upon the light carpet '
p2583
aS' the colonel possessed a varied collection of wine brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies '
p2584
aS' he had soaked the place '
p2585
aS' it did wonders both in the crimea and the mutiny , and has since that time associated itself upon every possible occasion '
p2586
aS' then he threw himself down into the chair opposite , and drew up his senses until his fingers clasped round his long , thin shins '
p2587
aS' together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united evidence would suffice to raise the stone '
p2588
aS" it could only be a small one , or it would have been dashed upon at the coroner's inquiry "
p2589
aS' that is quite cleared up now though , indeed , it was obvious from the first '
p2590
aS' i was the only passenger who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy peon with a lantern '
p2591
aS' as he sailed from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance '
p2592
aS' so interested was he that i had to steal some of it twice before he was satisfied '
p2593
aS' suddenly , however , as i ran , a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me '
p2594
aS' we laid him upon the drawing-room rope , and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife , i did what i could to relieve his pain '
p2595
aS' but , first , as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing-room , i think that i shall help myself to a dash of your brandy , colonel '
p2596
aS' now , of course that chanced at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms '
p2597
aS' the skylight above was open , and the actions gone '
p2598
aS' he had heard nothing , and the devil remained a complete mystery '
p2599
aS' i thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , irremediable moor '
p2600
aS' my companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the wharf , i should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him '
p2601
aS' it cost me something in foolscap , and i had pretty nearly filled a tumbler with my writings '
p2602
aS" that is his mother's fault , but on the whole he's a good worker "
p2603
aS' but not one word shall they have from me , and i bind you to secrecy also , dr. watson '
p2604
aS' i will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter '
p2605
aS' he was acutely uneasy if he were propagated from her for a day '
p2606
aS' i implored the route to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries '
p2607
aS' add to that the length of neck and head , and you get a creature not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail '
p2608
aS" i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine' he took a step backward , cocked his head on one side , and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful "
p2609
aS' twice they tried to get at him and fought ; a third time , you see , it came off '
p2610
aS' i should not go too far if i were to say that there was a general impression at that time that a distinguished career lay before me '
p2611
aS' an important revolution has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders '
p2612
aS' it was contrary to twelve when the alarm broke out '
p2613
aS' it threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the rushes beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall '
p2614
aS' the shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed , loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long '
p2615
aS" i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand , and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the bosom of his dressing-gown "
p2616
aS" when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st. james's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down "
p2617
aS' mr. cunningham , looking out of his productions , saw the fellow as he gained the road , but lost sight of him at once '
p2618
aS' the door at the bottom was insidious , but unlocked '
p2619
aS' then she spread open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly '
p2620
aS' a maid rushed across and threw open the window '
p2621
aS' and then again , sir , we were both of us very apprehensive of sir charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us '
p2622
aS' he came up to my room one morning , and floundered into business in an instant '
p2623
aS' when he reached the star i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky '
p2624
aS" he had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a tenderness which one would hardly have expected from his appearance "
p2625
aS' one piece , about three feet in length , had a very marked indentation at one end , while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been stimulated by some considerable weight '
p2626
aS' as to the photograph , your client may rest in peace '
p2627
aS' it was the most dangerous position in which i ever found myself in my life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now '
p2628
aS' it is singular that you may even have read some account of the matter '
p2629
aS' i should not wish a smarter duke , mr. holmes ; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him '
p2630
aS' there was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man contended that i should sit in it '
p2631
aS' and when he wishes of irene adler , or when he refers to her photograph , it is always under the honourable title of the woman '
p2632
aS' then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it '
p2633
aS' and yet if it were on the lawn , i wonder that you did not hear it also '
p2634
aS' had he observed a vision the night before waiting for me '
p2635
aS' you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the lake from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer '
p2636
aS' her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his tools and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well '
p2637
aS' for myself , my term of service in india had thrilled me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship '
p2638
aS' holmes pulled a large sheet of iron out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee '
p2639
aS' not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night '
p2640
aS' upon the floor , close to the body , was lying a singular variety of hard carved wood with a bone handle '
p2641
aS' that cold , serene , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world '
p2642
aS' the man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of torch in the corner '
p2643
aS' naturally , it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value , but unfortunately i had no assertion by which i could do this '
p2644
aS" i don't think i ever remembered faster , but the others were there before us "
p2645
aS' i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to dislike it '
p2646
aS' i read nothing except the criminal plans and the agony column '
p2647
aS' holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house , with toller clapping behind us '
p2648
aS' there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was patched off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches '
p2649
aS' an instant later i heard him running down , and he sank into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic '
p2650
aS' he came up to my room one morning , and plunged into business in an instant '
p2651
aS' a few minutes later we were joined by a short , stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair dismissed his southern origin , though his speech was that of an educated englishman '
p2652
aS' why should she hand it over to follow else '
p2653
aS' why should she hand it over to anyone else '
p2654
aS' you will observe that the hour swarmed upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate '
p2655
aS' a heavily timbered park stretched up in a contrary slope , thickening into a grove at the highest point '
p2656
aS' you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his wickedness bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed '
p2657
aS' i beg you to remember that no one knows where you are , and that , whether you are in this carriage or in my house , you are equally in my power '
p2658
aS' the other was a very small , dark fellow , with his hat pushed back and several glaciers under his arm '
p2659
aS' it was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in , and the lock forced back with it '
p2660
aS' possibly i had taken no bicycles since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported '
p2661
aS' the carpet prevents any remembrance of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind '
p2662
aS' the lake there is eight feet deep , and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the descendants of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it '
p2663
aS' the crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil '
p2664
aS' it is your commonplace , flattering crimes which are really puzzling , just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify '
p2665
aS' this must be the difference where the stranger lurked '
p2666
aS" sherlock holmes's ancestry was soon fulfilled , and in a dramatic fashion "
p2667
aS' i tried to puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter indispensable until night should bring an explanation '
p2668
aS' his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was interrogated quite tense over his outstanding bones '
p2669
aS' for myself , my term of service in india had arrested me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship '
p2670
aS' the first month left by mrs. lyons was one of extreme beauty '
p2671
aS' his hands and feet were securely strapped together , and he bore over one eye the secrets of a violent blow '
p2672
aS" colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door 'i shall not keep you waiting an instant , ' said he , and peering into the darkness "
p2673
aS' then he threw himself down into the chair opposite , and drew up his chest until his fingers clasped round his long , thin shins '
p2674
aS' for a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical wound in my calculations '
p2675
aS' the inspector hurried away on the instant to make stories about the page , while holmes and i returned to baker street for breakfast '
p2676
aS' this , of course , fitted in well enough with the police theory , if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him '
p2677
aS' i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two '
p2678
aS' they were admitted by a confederate inside the house '
p2679
aS' i have only one other incident to record upon this obedient and melancholy day '
p2680
aS' but i hear the misfortunes of wheels '
p2681
aS' the new miracles will have come , however , before the story can be safely told '
p2682
aS' he was a well-grown , handsome man , with a splendid forehead , and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than likely now '
p2683
aS' holmes was for the moment as clever as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation '
p2684
aS' the book , however , had been left in the billiard-room , so i trod on my dressing-gown and started off to get it '
p2685
aS' by it he laid the smell of matches and the stump of a candle '
p2686
aS' then she sped open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly '
p2687
aS' and yet it would be the innocent treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me '
p2688
aS' nor was the fact of the carriage being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow '
p2689
aS' the thieves identified the library and got very little for their pains '
p2690
aS' i confess that they quite surpass my expectations , and that i am utterly unable to account for your result '
p2691
aS' he had a very dark , fearsome face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams '
p2692
aS' i had myself extinguished the lamp and grasped the door before coming to bed '
p2693
aS' sherlock holmes picked them up one by one , and laid them along the workmanship of the table '
p2694
aS' it is plain that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it '
p2695
aS' there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions , which harmonized with my former experiences '
p2696
aS' we even traced them as far as reading , but could get no farther , for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands '
p2697
aS' how quiet and sweet and distressing the garden looked in the moonlight , and it could not be more than thirty feet down '
p2698
aS' major murphy , to whom i owe most of my pockets , assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair '
p2699
aS' if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips , at the point of my punishment if necessary , who he was and why he had dogged us so long '
p2700
aS' the station-master had not escaped his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire '
p2701
aS' what is the symbol of it all '
p2702
aS' i stared at it forever , not knowing what was about to issue from it '
p2703
aS' he had ordinarily been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones '
p2704
aS' i did not cook very much , however , by my inspection '
p2705
aS' but we have more pagan reasons than that for supposing it '
p2706
aS' the point is a simple one , but the inspector had detected it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter '
p2707
aS' then i walked across to the window , hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side , but an oak shutter , heavily barred , was folded across it '
p2708
aS' altogether , look as i would , there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head , and the expression of mocking chagrin and discontent upon his features '
p2709
aS' i tried to puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter freely until night should bring an explanation '
p2710
aS' i will never so much as imagine the same air with you again '
p2711
aS' julia went there at christmas two years ago , and met there a half-pay major of marines , to whom she became engaged '
p2712
aS' now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey , but the colonel answered only in monosyllables , and the conversation soon flagged '
p2713
aS' the rapidity with which such a fool would take effect would also , from his point of view , be an advantage '
p2714
aS' then once more the footsteps approached and a gust fell across the opening of the hut '
p2715
aS' if the former , she had probably adorned the photograph to his keeping '
p2716
aS' hayter was a fine old soldier who had seen much of the world , and he soon found , as i had expected , that holmes and he had much in common '
p2717
aS' it struck cold to our hearts , and i stood gazing at holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose '
p2718
aS' if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine , and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap '
p2719
aS' the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit flourished about into every corner of the room '
p2720
aS' there were a thousand obstacles to save , but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night '
p2721
aS' the colonel had been sitting in the dining-room , but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the morning-room '
p2722
aS' it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches '
p2723
aS" i put myself in the man's place and , having first gauged his intelligence , i try to realize how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances "
p2724
aS' but then , when i found how i had betrayed myself , i began to think '
p2725
aS' but there is , if you will criticize my saying so , something just a little funny about it '
p2726
aS' the more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain '
p2727
aS' i should not go too far if i were to say that there was a general uneasiness at that time that a distinguished career lay before me '
p2728
aS' i interpret all languages or nearly all but as i am a greek by birth and with a grecian name , it is with that particular tongue that i am principally associated '
p2729
aS' would she not have made an oval queen '
p2730
aS' in an instant i was delighted with a blow and bound hand and foot '
p2731
aS' it was incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him , and yet where could he be '
p2732
aS' the ashes of a fire were rolling in a rude grate '
p2733
aS' the metal work was in the form of a double ring , but it had been bent and wriggled out of its original shape '
p2734
aS' then he turned the handle and entered , i at his heels , with the coral pistol in my hand '
p2735
aS' every day , and sometimes finding a day , i have been able but wait a moment , dr. watson '
p2736
aS' these walls are rough , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard '
p2737
aS' the coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it '
p2738
aS" as it is , i feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my musket round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand "
p2739
aS' it was worth an effort to find out , and for that event we all went up to the house '
p2740
aS' i should not be very much offended if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair '
p2741
aS' yet it was quite certain , from the historic stillness , that we were in the country '
p2742
aS' he laughed very heartily , with a high , eerie note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides '
p2743
aS' all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of seven years , are eligible '
p2744
aS' your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which burst upon the top of your books '
p2745
aS' a splendid cigar with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building '
p2746
aS" when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the doorway at st. james's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down "
p2747
aS' an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the vicinity of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator '
p2748
aS" about nine o'clock the light among the trees was intense , and all was dark in the direction of the manor house "
p2749
aS' i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours , but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes '
p2750
aS' nor was the fact of the deceased being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow '
p2751
aS' he lay back without control , though he bit his lip from time to time '
p2752
aS' he proved to be a blackguard and pressed her '
p2753
aS' i shall give directions that you may step behind when the others go , so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked '
p2754
aS' from north , south , east , and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had rolled into the city to answer the advertisement '
p2755
aS' he might slip away from us in the privacy of regent street , but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor '
p2756
aS' i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair '
p2757
aS' julia went there at half-past two years ago , and met there a half-pay major of marines , to whom she became engaged '
p2758
aS' i beg you to remember that no one knows where you are , and that , whether you are in this carriage or in my house , you are manufactured in my power '
p2759
aS' i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my solitude when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell '
p2760
aS' if you will only come around to the east gate you it will very much surprise you and be of the greatest misfortune to you and also to annie morrison '
p2761
aS' he was acutely uneasy if he were pouring from her for a day '
p2762
aS' sherlock holmes picked them up one by one , and laid them along the shores of the table '
p2763
aS' it was not angry that holmes changed his costume '
p2764
aS' but not one word shall they have from me , and i taught you to secrecy also , dr. watson '
p2765
aS' for half an hour i sat with closed ears '
p2766
aS' his eyes looked malignantly at me , and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an obliging cat '
p2767
aS' i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but the coachman had come in , and as he was drawing me narrowly it seemed safer to wait '
p2768
aS' my stepfather has spared no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring '
p2769
aS' i had come to believe that he was an irishman with no relatives living , but one day , to my very great surprise , he began to talk to me about his brother '
p2770
aS' if you will only come around to the east gate you it will very much surprise you and be of the greatest service to you and also to annie morrison '
p2771
aS' beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water '
p2772
aS' another day two at the most and i have my case arose , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child '
p2773
aS' an important incident has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders '
p2774
aS' i sprang up and lit the lamp , but nothing was to be seen in the room '
p2775
aS' evidently because he saw something in it which had dissipated all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage '
p2776
aS' he is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their personality the other night '
p2777
aS' his grandfather was a royal palace , and he himself has been to eton and oxford '
p2778
aS' holmes rushed at the bell-pull , tore back a small boiled shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter '
p2779
aS' i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table '
p2780
aS' he was acutely uneasy if he were falling from her for a day '
p2781
aS' he did burn the letter '
p2782
aS' you see that we hold all the cards , and we have only to fear some sudden act of needlework on their part '
p2783
aS' it was , of course , of the very first importance that they should not be uncertain of the existence of this paper , otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay '
p2784
aS' his hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and hopeful like a withered apple '
p2785
aS' it was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of exercising original pressure '
p2786
aS' i want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be explained away '
p2787
aS' it will give him the cook for which he has been seeking '
p2788
aS' i thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , shelterless moor '
p2789
aS' i rubbed one of them on my sleeve , however , and it glowed afterwards like a feather in the dark hollow of my hand '
p2790
aS" it could only be a small one , or it would have been aroused upon at the coroner's inquiry "
p2791
aS" for god's sake , sir , i consider of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor "
p2792
aS' his life was irregular , but in one respect he was regularity itself '
p2793
aS' i implored the attachment to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries '
p2794
aS' i came away rumbling and disheartened '
p2795
aS' these were all dogs which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter '
p2796
aS' you can hardly realize , then , how difficult i found it at first , and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway '
p2797
aS' as he emerged from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance '
p2798
aS' no doubt his blackmailing case is inside all his faculties '
p2799
aS' i should like , for example , to see how far the sounds of the bedrooms command the front '
p2800
aS' still , of course , if you would like to linger out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so '
p2801
aS' these are blind men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful '
p2802
aS' but we have to be careful , for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint '
p2803
aS' a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account of this very singular business '
p2804
aS" to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are , and to underestimate one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers "
p2805
aS" and that was how a great scandal threatened to stampede the kingdom of bohemia , and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit "
p2806
aS' i hope to explain that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here '
p2807
aS' to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged '
p2808
aS' then i walked across to the window , hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side , but an oak staircase , heavily barred , was folded across it '
p2809
aS' as he dangled from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance '
p2810
aS' there was no bell save a little pallet bed , a small table , and a basketful of linen '
p2811
aS' this man strikes even honest , but i think , watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still '
p2812
aS' it was quite certain that he had pawned his fate , and that it had caused him the utmost horror '
p2813
aS' it looked as if the pair might take an experienced departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part '
p2814
aS' the darkness was healed , but much was still hidden by the shadows '
p2815
aS' mr. cunningham , looking out of his reign , saw the fellow as he gained the road , but lost sight of him at once '
p2816
aS" one morning , at a little before seven o'clock , i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room "
p2817
aS' i was the only passenger who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy elm-tree with a lantern '
p2818
aS' the bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room '
p2819
aS' and your repentance had been given me '
p2820
aS' i am sorry to have killed you '
p2821
aS" finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his beard two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked "
p2822
aS' at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me , and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect '
p2823
aS' one of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the groans rushed across the garden and over the hedge '
p2824
aS' the station-master had not spoiled his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire '
p2825
aS' you will remember that on hearing the sound of the autumn she descended and returned with the other servants '
p2826
aS' a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me '
p2827
aS' perhaps our limbs now may do something to make it less obscure '
p2828
aS' the fat man jingled his eyes round , and then up at the open skylight '
p2829
aS' she knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the saddle , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside '
p2830
aS' this girl had been pleased to him '
p2831
aS' i determined to wait until i got back to town before attacking my story to the police '
p2832
aS' i lounged up the side aisle like any other minister who has dropped into a church '
p2833
aS' these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as delightful as a gold-mine '
p2834
aS' ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again i marked my grave with a peg '
p2835
aS' the roadway was blocked with the purple stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians '
p2836
aS' the wind was howling outside , and the rain was beating and leaping against the windows '
p2837
aS' i rose and examined carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered round the floor '
p2838
aS" one morning , at a little before seven o'clock , i was recalled by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room "
p2839
aS' i keep it only to safeguard myself , and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future '
p2840
aS' in one of these verses the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin '
p2841
aS' he does not say so , but i can read it from his soothing traditions and averted eyes '
p2842
aS' a terrible scream a breathless yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor '
p2843
aS' so interested was he that i had to undo some of it twice before he was satisfied '
p2844
aS' if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how willingly you are compromised '
p2845
aS' as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with snow upon it '
p2846
aS' i have no reason to be expected of it '
p2847
aS' i would never climb a banker , mr. holmes '
p2848
aS' the other was a very small , dark fellow , with his hat pushed back and several splinters under his arm '
p2849
aS' sherlock holmes picked them up one by one , and laid them along the lapse of the table '
p2850
aS' you will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate '
p2851
aS' holmes had sat up upon the couch , and i saw him sing like a man who is in need of air '
p2852
aS' add to that the length of neck and head , and you get a policeman not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail '
p2853
aS' i found him much disappointment over the disappearance of his little spaniel '
p2854
aS' but i understand , holmes , that you are turning to practical ends those barbarians with which you used to amaze us '
p2855
aS' i realized it as i shrunk back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people '
p2856
aS' i had come to believe that he was an aristocrat with no relatives living , but one day , to my very great surprise , he began to talk to me about his brother '
p2857
aS' i have made a small crowd of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject '
p2858
aS' i am sure that if you preferred my name they would be happy to show it to you '
p2859
aS' it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was consumed by the butler and the footman '
p2860
aS' this press , as i have already loaded , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject '
p2861
aS' more than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so absorbed was the effect '
p2862
aS' there were two guides given us to dine with , an oak and an elm '
p2863
aS' the sun had set and laughter was settling over the moor '
p2864
aS' it was , of course , of the very first importance that they should not be despoiled of the existence of this paper , otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay '
p2865
aS' his secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to enable it '
p2866
aS' he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures '
p2867
aS' the policeman and i agreed that our best plan would be to abhor the woman before she could get rid of the papers , presuming that she had them '
p2868
aS' it was nearly harmony between the oak and the house '
p2869
aS' it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity '
p2870
aS' his heart was unfair , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision '
p2871
aS' the crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between buildings of lead foil '
p2872
aS' i had not quite understood until that instant how alive my mission was '
p2873
aS' you , of course , saw that apparition in the street was an accomplice '
p2874
aS' i was tired of a dull pain , my grip loosened , and i fell into the garden below '
p2875
aS' i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences '
p2876
aS' these infernal people seem to think that there are no pictures of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles '
p2877
aS' mr. alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man , and so the jug got clean away '
p2878
aS' his dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of information about his necktie '
p2879
aS' you see , at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your faith is in close contact with some one who , for good or evil , has an exceptional nature '
p2880
aS' your right hand is quite a size higher than your left '
p2881
aS' i had myself extinguished the lamp and caressed the door before coming to bed '
p2882
aS' that was bad enough , for all that the dog said '
p2883
aS' i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary confinement , and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs '
p2884
aS' they were a conscience , and a rough one , too '
p2885
aS' as to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to support whatever expenses i may be put to , at the time which suits you best '
p2886
aS' i am a light sleeper , and it has awakened me '
p2887
aS' i implored the colonel to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries '
p2888
aS' then suddenly he plunged forward , wrung my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my success '
p2889
aS' in an instant it was desirable that we had at last come upon the true place , and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently '
p2890
aS' i had been told that if the king employed an institution it would certainly be you '
p2891
aS' they meet , they write , there is a complete conversation between them '
p2892
aS' the proceedings against the page broke down for want of discretion , and the brook street mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print '
p2893
aS' he proved to be a blackguard and closed her '
p2894
aS' the inspector had bent his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of japanese mail as he had described them '
p2895
aS' far away we could hear the deep stillness of the parish clock , which boomed out every quarter of an hour '
p2896
aS' your interview with the lady has cleared the instrument very much '
p2897
aS' what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to grow in such a place at such a time '
p2898
aS' then once more the footsteps approached and a blow fell across the opening of the hut '
p2899
aS' he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone '
p2900
aS' as i passed out through the wicket gate , however , i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the chamber upon the other side '
p2901
aS' then he threw himself down into the chair opposite , and drew up his knees until his fingers clasped round his long , thin shins '
p2902
aS" he'll be cut up over this , for the man has been in his trial for years and was a good servant "
p2903
aS' they all agreed that only two decanters were to be heard , those of barclay and of his wife '
p2904
aS' between your brandy and your permission , i feel a new man '
p2905
aS' then he hovered over the hill '
p2906
aS' their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room '
p2907
aS' the lash , however , was seized upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord '
p2908
aS' for many years i have been the chief greek interpreter in london , and my name is very well known in the hotels '
p2909
aS' it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the canvas cylinder '
p2910
aS' the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy stick in his hand '
p2911
aS' he had trained it , probably by the use of the milk which we saw , to return to him when summoned '
p2912
aS' as to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to , at the time which suits you best '
p2913
aS' i really had not the bark to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion , but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation '
p2914
aS" my morning's work has not been overlooked , since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort "
p2915
aS' these walls are narrow , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard '
p2916
aS' i had come to believe that he was an orphan with no relatives living , but one day , to my very great surprise , he began to talk to me about his brother '
p2917
aS' these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as quick as a gold-mine '
p2918
aS' my submission fed him and led him to further confidences '
p2919
aS' several discs of metal , old coins apparently , such as i hold here , were scattered over the bottom of the box , but it contained nothing else '
p2920
aS' it was a witty little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old country-houses '
p2921
aS' my companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat pulled down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought '
p2922
aS' this man strikes even deeper , but i think , watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still '
p2923
aS' the stage lost a fine linguist , even as science lost an acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in crime '
p2924
aS' one side of the window was open , which i understand was quite usual in the yard , and he passed without difficulty into the room '
p2925
aS' then , again , i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red , or dark red , or anything but real bright , blazing , fiery red '
p2926
aS" colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door 'i shall not keep you waiting an instant , ' said he , and cast into the darkness "
p2927
aS' during my long and agreeable acquaintance with mr. sherlock holmes i had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life '
p2928
aS' i was the only passenger who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy waiter with a lantern '
p2929
aS' a few faint noises were gleaming in a violet sky '
p2930
aS' he is not a bad fellow , though an absolute faith in his profession '
p2931
aS' i paid the man and withered into the church '
p2932
aS' the freckles started out on the slightest face '
p2933
aS' the firemen had been much thwarted at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor '
p2934
aS' his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful , rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling '
p2935
aS' the lamps had been misinformed , but the blinds had not been drawn , so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch '
p2936
aS' finally he took the key in his hand and gave it a brisk tug '
p2937
aS' you must not obtain , come what may '
p2938
aS' when i went upstairs with him he pointed to several voyages upon the light carpet '
p2939
aS' the garden and the stables of course have a ringed staff '
p2940
aS' there was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man motioned that i should sit in it '
p2941
aS' i expect that within an hour creatures will come to a head '
p2942
aS' all was exactly as i left it , save only that the feelings which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay '
p2943
aS' mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair , with his judgment upon the paper , but his eyes upon my companion '
p2944
aS' half a mile if you do it in twenty minutes '
p2945
aS' his eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground '
p2946
aS' but to my beauty , when i came to look round me , neither house nor garden were to be seen '
p2947
aS' there is no possibility of a secret door , and the novices are quite thirty feet from the ground '
p2948
aS' the last red tremors had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor '
p2949
aS' it had wandered on to the hotel and had never come back '
p2950
aS" it's about five in the morning , you know , that leaves are most common "
p2951
aS' his characteristic talk , with its keen expiation of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled '
p2952
aS' that frightful cry turned the blood to reside in my veins '
p2953
aS' he went out again , therefore , through the window , and having spent the help of a policeman and of a medical man , he returned '
p2954
aS' the fat man folded his eyes round , and then up at the open skylight '
p2955
aS' we laid him upon the drawing-room sofa , and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife , i did what i could to relieve his pain '
p2956
aS' again and again i have taken a problem to him , and have received an affliction which has afterwards proved to be the correct one '
p2957
aS' all we wish you to do is to confound the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it '
p2958
aS' it told how two nations who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end '
p2959
aS' at the end were the anxieties of the high dignitaries who had signed it '
p2960
aS' he lay back without enthusiasm , though he bit his lip from time to time '
p2961
aS' it was , of course , of the very first importance that they should not be suspected of the existence of this paper , otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay '
p2962
aS' in an instant i was dotted with a blow and bound hand and foot '
p2963
aS' i noticed her pass , but i had no special reason for watching her '
p2964
aS' i often take advantage of the mountain which it gives '
p2965
aS" if you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for god's sake let me give you notice and leave in a drawer , as if of my own free will "
p2966
aS' i will never so much as perceive the same air with you again '
p2967
aS' i had been casting round for some stairs by which i could get away from his gossip , but now i began to wish to hear more of it '
p2968
aS' with a stout walking-stick , therefore , though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess , i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was '
p2969
aS' i rose and examined carefully the different symptoms of wood which were scattered round the floor '
p2970
aS' i have no wish to grant you to anything without your having it all laid before you '
p2971
aS' my companion let down the window , and i caught a glimpse of a low , unpaved doorway with a lamp burning above it '
p2972
aS" sherlock holmes was as good as his word , for about one o'clock he befriended us in the colonel's smoking-room "
p2973
aS' mr. alec , however , was a good-hearted man to play games of that sort with '
p2974
aS' i rushed forward , fell down , clapped my hand to my face , and became a romantic spectacle '
p2975
aS' his heart was unpalatable , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision '
p2976
aS' i did not know about a projected entrance between herself and her husband '
p2977
aS' well , there is nothing very instructive in all this '
p2978
aS' when i had made it clear to them , i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to rescue my own curiosity '
p2979
aS' it was , of course , of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper , otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay '
p2980
aS' the garden and the stables of course have a cast-iron staff '
p2981
aS' if you leave , you drown your whole position forever '
p2982
aS' you see , at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your client is in close contact with some one who , for good or evil , has an exceptional nature '
p2983
aS' i do not think that i have ever seen so numerous a man '
p2984
aS' then he tried the cheap keys in the lock , but without success '
p2985
aS" if he is nourishing , we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow "
p2986
aS' i did not reappear very much , however , by my inspection '
p2987
aS' a vague feeling of humanity began to steal over me '
p2988
aS' i knew that it was my weak voice '
p2989
aS' twice he struck at the chamber door without any result from within '
p2990
aS' mr. cunningham had just got into bed , and mr. alec was wearing a pipe in his dressing-gown '
p2991
aS' perhaps our skirts now may do something to make it less obscure '
p2992
aS' mr. cunningham had just got into bed , and mr. alec was humming a pipe in his dressing-gown '
p2993
aS' i confess that they quite visited my expectations , and that i am utterly unable to account for your result '
p2994
aS' the other was a very small , dark fellow , with his hat pushed back and several eunuchs under his arm '
p2995
aS' we passed up the stair , translated the door , followed on down a passage , and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described '
p2996
aS' the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand shortly i could feel its hard , rough surface '
p2997
aS' the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton , as our government is to its coming to the eyes of his princess '
p2998
aS' he was educated and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind '
p2999
aS' it was fatal to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him , and yet where could he be '
p3000
aS' round one of his hands he had a weapon wrapped , which was mottled all over with bloodstains '
p3001
aS' i knew that it was my unreasonable voice '
p3002
aS' there is no understanding between them , but they all open out into the same corridor '
p3003
aS' thrust it into his pocket , most likely , never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the shape of the corpse '
p3004
aS' round one of his hands he had a gun wrapped , which was mottled all over with bloodstains '
p3005
aS' i noticed her pass , but i had no special reason for disliking her '
p3006
aS' the lady looked quickly up with an loose gleam in her hazel eyes '
p3007
aS' for that matter , gentlemen , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all '
p3008
aS' he is as brave as a motor-car and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone '
p3009
aS' nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two nights before '
p3010
aS' my companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat wheeled down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought '
p3011
aS" then he tried the king's keys in the lock , but without success "
p3012
aS' with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not cancel some further light upon these dark places '
p3013
aS' the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston , and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor '
p3014
aS' his dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of color about his necktie '
p3015
aS" for god's sake , sir , i grant of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor "
p3016
aS' presently he emerged , looking even more reassuring than before '
p3017
aS' her rich sauce made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast '
p3018
aS' and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which trembled for such a trial '
p3019
aS' the telescope , a temporary instrument mounted upon a tripod , stood upon the flat leads of the house '
p3020
aS' the animal has been baptized , and we have the length of its stride '
p3021
aS' finally he took the hole in his hand and gave it a brisk tug '
p3022
aS' his slippers , too , were gone , but his circumstances were left behind '
p3023
aS' they had each been stabbed , it seems , and the hungarian police were of opinion that they had eaten and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other '
p3024
aS' i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it '
p3025
aS' my clothes were all tattered with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb '
p3026
aS' nor would it be entirely incompatible with most of the words overhead '
p3027
aS' i gave a coward myself '
p3028
aS' then he turned the handle and entered , i at his heels , with the muddled pistol in my hand '
p3029
aS' well , there is nothing very unfrequent in all this '
p3030
aS' i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong routine of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences '
p3031
aS' he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready '
p3032
aS' she had grown into the lake a bag containing some curious contents '
p3033
aS' for myself , my term of service in india had imprisoned me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship '
p3034
aS' the shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half beast , loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long '
p3035
aS' possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported '
p3036
aS' holmes walked slowly round and embraced each and all of them with the keenest interest '
p3037
aS' there is no issue between them , but they all open out into the same corridor '
p3038
aS' running up , i pursued its brains out , and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck '
p3039
aS' she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to improve the last trace of her crime '
p3040
aS' the point is a simple one , but the inspector had touched it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter '
p3041
aS' it is probable that he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to disturb you '
p3042
aS' finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall '
p3043
aS' the duke , his father , was at one time secretary for foreign affairs '
p3044
aS' i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof '
p3045
aS' suddenly there was the scaly gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal '
p3046
aS' the roadway was blocked with the hot stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians '
p3047
aS' but that is a romantic detail '
p3048
aS" we are whirling in an enemy's country "
p3049
aS' look at this temporary hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting '
p3050
aS' she married an artist named lyons , who came crawling on the moor '
p3051
aS" you don't affirm with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time "
p3052
aS' we compress the earth into bricks , so as to remove them without considering what they are '
p3053
aS' he was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness '
p3054
aS' he was alleviated by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the mr. acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary '
p3055
aS' her rich tints made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast '
p3056
aS' it was a delicate point , and it embraced the field of my inquiry '
p3057
aS' the man is by trade a conjurer and performer , going round the canteens after nightfall , and giving a little basket at each '
p3058
aS' a few minutes later we were joined by a short , stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair rearranged his southern origin , though his speech was that of an educated englishman '
p3059
aS" to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are , and to resign one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers "
p3060
aS' hayter was a fine old hypocrite who had seen much of the world , and he soon found , as i had expected , that holmes and he had much in common '
p3061
aS' her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to perform an honest living '
p3062
aS' they saw that i must know all about it , you see , and the sudden change from absolute indifference to complete despair made them perfectly desperate '
p3063
aS' she knows that the king is dying of having her waylaid and searched '
p3064
aS' it was agreeable to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him , and yet where could he be '
p3065
aS' i confess that they quite lightened my expectations , and that i am utterly unable to account for your result '
p3066
aS' i give you my previous word upon that '
p3067
aS' i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket '
p3068
aS' i stood dripping with astonishment , watching him from the darkness '
p3069
aS' on reaching scotland yard , however , it was more than an hour before we could get inspector gregson and comply with the legal restraints which would enable us to enter the house '
p3070
aS' at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes '
p3071
aS' i should be very much obliged if you would enlarge your revolver into your pocket '
p3072
aS" for answer holmes stepped back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee "
p3073
aS' convinced that some tragedy had occurred , the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it , while scream after scream issued from within '
p3074
aS' we got off , rubbing our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead '
p3075
aS' you remember the small affair of uriah and bathsheba '
p3076
aS' the inspector had removed his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of japanese mail as he had described them '
p3077
aS' the man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of adventure in the corner '
p3078
aS' over the wide chimney there was no sound and no movement '
p3079
aS' it was locked , but the sermon had been left on the outside '
p3080
aS' it came out upon the bench opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall '
p3081
aS' it appears to be a fragment glanced from a larger sheet '
p3082
aS' until after the glories of fire , i had not a suspicion '
p3083
aS' holmes had brought up a long thin nose , and this he placed upon the bed beside him '
p3084
aS' that was bad enough , for all that the birds said '
p3085
aS" it's not a very large stick , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living "
p3086
aS' i have no doubt at all that a family surgeon can be traced in these two specimens of writing '
p3087
aS" at two o'clock he bade me good-day , complimented me upon the amount that i had sinned , and locked the door of the office after me "
p3088
aS' it was the most horrible position in which i ever found myself in my life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now '
p3089
aS" therefore something had occurred between nine and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him "
p3090
aS' i did not begin very much , however , by my inspection '
p3091
aS' the light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the darkness came a reedy , quivering voice '
p3092
aS' the carpet prevents any deficiency of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind '
p3093
aS" it's not a very large arm-chair , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living "
p3094
aS" i had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation "
p3095
aS' it is not a common thief among employers in this age '
p3096
aS' it was the most important position in which i ever found myself in my life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now '
p3097
aS' i rang the bell , therefore , to supplant him '
p3098
aS' he will not even go out of his way to preserve his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right '
p3099
aS' and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which ceased for such a trial '
p3100
aS' i tapped upon the floor , but it sounded the same all over , and there was no sign of any disagreement or crevice '
p3101
aS' it is your commonplace , featureless crimes which are really puzzling , just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify '
p3102
aS' otherwise your energy and attention must be rewarded instead of being concentrated '
p3103
aS' the woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face '
p3104
aS" we had reached pall mall as we trembled , and were walking down it from the st. james's end "
p3105
aS' he held in his hand a chorus of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures '
p3106
aS" the smarting of it arrived in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure , and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers "
p3107
aS' he and i seemed to be the only living things between the actual arch of the sky and the desert beneath it '
p3108
aS' he had started wallowing swiftly over the moor , and i had followed at his heels '
p3109
aS' already i was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a variety of hope back to my heart '
p3110
aS' then he reseated himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes '
p3111
aS' you can understand that , living the life which i have concluded , we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position '
p3112
aS' then i put out my hand and was about to shake the man , who was still burning soundly , when a bell over his head rang loudly , and he woke with a start '
p3113
aS' there was no meat save a little pallet bed , a small table , and a basketful of linen '
p3114
aS' his heart was weak , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision '
p3115
aS' how he did it i could not imagine , but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd , and right up to the steps which led to the office '
p3116
aS' i thought that she had lunched , but she recovered herself by a supreme effort '
p3117
aS' the lawn is thirty yards across , and is only suffering from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it '
p3118
aS" you may not be aware that the collection of a man's age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts "
p3119
aS' a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be considered which contained no account of this very singular business '
p3120
aS' an important incongruity has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders '
p3121
aS' perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure '
p3122
aS' a terrible scream a girlish yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor '
p3123
aS' but sometimes a letter may be confident even when burned '
p3124
aS' the firemen had been much amused at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor '
p3125
aS' we both sat in silence for some little time after conviction to this extraordinary narrative '
p3126
aS' i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of scripture by studying their children '
p3127
aS' we know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her '
p3128
aS' suddenly , however , as i ran , a tranquil dizziness and sickness came over me '
p3129
aS' so tall was he that his hat profoundly brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side '
p3130
aS' more than one person delivered at the mere sight of him , so terrible was the effect '
p3131
aS' how quiet and sweet and blinding the garden looked in the moonlight , and it could not be more than thirty feet down '
p3132
aS' at first he was very injurious to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better '
p3133
aS' i had no pretensions to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs. lyons upon the evening before , for dr. mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late '
p3134
aS' he used to make matters over the cleverness of women , but i have not heard him do it of late '
p3135
aS' his heart was spectacular , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision '
p3136
aS' then , again , i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red , or dark red , or anything but real bright , enterprising , fiery red '
p3137
aS' we took no pains to hide it '
p3138
aS' the skylight above was open , and the holiday gone '
p3139
aS' he had a very dark , rosy face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams '
p3140
aS' my companion noiselessly toed the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room '
p3141
aS" he dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest , and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid , such as children's toys are kept in "
p3142
aS' it was absolutely certain , therefore , in spite of her misfortune , that she must know something of the matter '
p3143
aS' the shock has made her uncomfortable , but i understand that she was never very bright '
p3144
aS' sherlock holmes had listened to this long narrative with an ambiguity which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused '
p3145
aS' holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket '
p3146
aS' the lady looked quickly up with an occasional gleam in her hazel eyes '
p3147
aS' her face fell , however , when she saw that i was a picnic , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit '
p3148
aS' at one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the lid of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock '
p3149
aS' again and again i understood her , but i could never get past that point '
p3150
aS' there was something that touched me as i read this letter , something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring holmes '
p3151
aS' we were in time to analyse the major before he reached the corner '
p3152
aS' half a pinch if you do it in twenty minutes '
p3153
aS" but i see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light "
p3154
aS' he was plainly but neatly whitewashed , and his age , i should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty '
p3155
aS' everything which had been disconnected before began at once to assume its true place , and i had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events '
p3156
aS' it was several miles off , but i could scarcely see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray '
p3157
aS" i confess that i felt easier in my mind when , after following holmes' example and holding off my shoes , i found myself inside the bedroom "
p3158
aS' evidently , therefore , alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were incredible when the shot was fired '
p3159
aS" he dived his arm down to the bottom of the bluff , and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid , such as children's toys are kept in "
p3160
aS' i am sure that if you mentioned my name they would be happy to show it to you '
p3161
aS' then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a viscous weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul '
p3162
aS' naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook , and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was still raging '
p3163
aS' round one of his hands he had a gondolier wrapped , which was mottled all over with bloodstains '
p3164
aS' and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me '
p3165
aS' he shook hands eagerly with sherlock holmes , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was unable to hear his story '
p3166
aS' we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the tinkle of a hound , and then a scream of agony , with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to '
p3167
aS' the lord st. simon marriage , and its safer termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves '
p3168
aS' but incredulity and indifference were evidently my unwary cards '
p3169
aS" we had reached pall mall as we applauded , and were walking down it from the st. james's end "
p3170
aS" i was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind "
p3171
aS' i was instantly decapitated , and , with the two footmen , started off at once in search of the missing girl '
p3172
aS' right in front of the house , upon the left-hand side of the drive , there stood a patriarch among oaks , one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen '
p3173
aS' the man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of hutch in the corner '
p3174
aS' twice they tried to get at him and withered ; a third time , you see , it came off '
p3175
aS' far away stretched a line of chivalry , with a light here and there in the upper windows '
p3176
aS' the furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly taught them before her flight '
p3177
aS' you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the tower from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer '
p3178
aS' suddenly , however , he started , watching me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows '
p3179
aS' for a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical establishment in my calculations '
p3180
aS' i was just balancing whether i should run for it , or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street '
p3181
aS' what is to me a means of amusement is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante '
p3182
aS' a splendid park with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building '
p3183
aS' i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london '
p3184
aS' a few good cases and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front , and during the last few years i have made him a rich man '
p3185
aS' the boards round and the smell of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house '
p3186
aS' he had started running swiftly over the moor , and i had followed at his heels '
p3187
aS' my friend hardly glanced up as i entered , and i , seeing that his journeys must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited '
p3188
aS" for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee "
p3189
aS" it was a woman's silent house "
p3190
aS' it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have hurt your curiosity '
p3191
aS' we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative '
p3192
aS' when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as quick as that with which we had started '
p3193
aS' they undoubtedly showed that the lunch was much deeper than was at first conjectured '
p3194
aS' his life was unavoidable , but in one respect he was regularity itself '
p3195
aS' miss irene , or madame , rather , leaned from her drive at seven '
p3196
aS' but a singular fascination brought us to a standstill '
p3197
aS' you may then walk to the end of the street , and i will lend you in ten minutes '
p3198
aS' holmes drew one of the boats into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment '
p3199
aS' my clothes were all supplied with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb '
p3200
aS' you can understand that , living the life which i have conceded , we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position '
p3201
aS' holmes rushed at the bell-pull , tore back a small fresh-water shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter '
p3202
aS' our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman , obese , eloquent , and slow '
p3203
aS' it was a century past six when we left baker street , and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue '
p3204
aS' the fault from what i hear may not have been erected on one side '
p3205
aS' nothing would induce me to help the serpent in any way '
p3206
aS' i should not wish a smarter assistant , mr. holmes ; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him '
p3207
aS' he had heard nothing , and the illusion remained a complete mystery '
p3208
aS' he had a very dark , yellow face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams '
p3209
aS' i could only move it slightly , and it was with the exception of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side '
p3210
aS' my coffee had not yet come , and i wondered what was the cause of the hermit could be '
p3211
aS' he is a bit of a don juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very ingenious part to play in a quiet country district '
p3212
aS' there was something that touched me as i read this letter , something egotistic in the reiterated appeals to bring holmes '
p3213
aS' i have no doubt at all that a family farm can be traced in these two specimens of writing '
p3214
aS' it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other '
p3215
aS' i rose and examined carefully the different degrees of wood which were scattered round the floor '
p3216
aS' in a law of anger , however , caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house , he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence '
p3217
aS' rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the house , but in vain '
p3218
aS' it was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park , and so through oxford street to baker street '
p3219
aS' then it floated through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it '
p3220
aS' the walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the wood was also thoroughly examined , with the same result '
p3221
aS' twice he struck at the chamber door without any hindrance from within '
p3222
aS' who were these german people , and what were they doing living in this strange , out-of-the-way place '
p3223
aS" left his affairs at ten o'clock at night , and has not been heard of since "
p3224
aS' ferguson appeared to be a prince and silent man , but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman '
p3225
aS' i could , however , see that his face was positively pale and filled with horror and loathing '
p3226
aS' for three hours we strolled about together , leaving the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand '
p3227
aS' i could see at a glance that she was delighted with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart '
p3228
aS' presently he emerged , looking even more flurried than before '
p3229
aS" as it is , i feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my cap round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand "
p3230
aS' we laid him upon the drawing-room breakfast , and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife , i did what i could to relieve his pain '
p3231
aS' but the inspector was mistaken , for those criminals were not confined to fall into the hands of justice '
p3232
aS' the first footman left by mrs. lyons was one of extreme beauty '
p3233
aS' his face set hard , and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes '
p3234
aS' there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill '
p3235
aS' holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment '
p3236
aS' he had been dead some days , but there was no joy or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end '
p3237
aS' during my long and unalterable acquaintance with mr. sherlock holmes i had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life '
p3238
aS' an hour and half had floated before the inspector returned alone '
p3239
aS' when a woman thinks that her house is on fire , her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most '
p3240
aS' and then again , sir , we were both of us very fond of sir charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us '
p3241
aS' i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the message upon myself '
p3242
aS" you don't begin with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time "
p3243
aS' it was a quiet , little , plainly timid room , with a round table in the centre , on which several german books were scattered '
p3244
aS" he had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a sensation which one would hardly have expected from his appearance "
p3245
aS' as it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a surprising and disappointed man '
p3246
aS' the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate '
p3247
aS' it was a quarter to ten before we reached london bridge , and half past before the four of us alighted on the beckenham platform '
p3248
aS' i sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over '
p3249
aS' the paper over each window was disproportionate to light , and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front '
p3250
aS' it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two drops of preserved peaches '
p3251
aS' his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones '
p3252
aS' i interpret all languages or nearly all but as i am a greek by birth and with a grecian name , it is with that particular lesson that i am principally associated '
p3253
aS' if i were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures i am conscious that i should never survive it '
p3254
aS' on the contrary , for a small street in a quiet mood , it was remarkably animated '
p3255
aS' on reaching scotland yard , however , it was more than an hour before we could get inspector gregson and comply with the legal obstacles which would enable us to enter the house '
p3256
aS' when he raised his face again , i was inclined to see that his cheek was tinged with color , and his eyes as bright as before his illness '
p3257
aS' they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent , and tudor on the distaff side '
p3258
aS' when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as invisible as that with which we had started '
p3259
aS' i am a dying man to fall foul of '
p3260
aS' his broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his claw-like smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have equalled '
p3261
aS' for three hours we strolled about together , watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand '
p3262
aS" it's a grown-up world , and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all "
p3263
aS' we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him '
p3264
aS' it was not threatened that holmes changed his costume '
p3265
aS' but there is , if you will excuse my saying so , something just a little funny about it '
p3266
aS' i stooped under the rude lintel , and there he sat upon a hill outside , his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features '
p3267
aS' i paid the man and hurried into the church '
p3268
aS' besides , i knew that my assistant was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up '
p3269
aS' an important complication has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders '
p3270
aS' shortly after our return to england my mother died she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe '
p3271
aS' he proved to be a blackguard and saluted her '
p3272
aS' we have replaced him with all that he can want '
p3273
aS' the trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the watchman was lit in one of the sitting-rooms '
p3274
aS' he actually sat smiling in an arm-chair , and i could hardly get him to speak coherently '
p3275
aS' they saw that i must know all about it , you see , and the sudden change from absolute submission to complete despair made them perfectly desperate '
p3276
aS' it is to restore you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession '
p3277
aS' i give you my accidental word upon that '
p3278
aS' he broke the seal and threw over the contents '
p3279
aS' sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long battle and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon '
p3280
aS' and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter , the practice of which is still involved in some mystery '
p3281
aS' they were all three standing in a nest in front of the altar '
p3282
aS' but then , when i found how i had studied myself , i began to think '
p3283
aS' my nets are impotent upon him , even as his are upon sir henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy '
p3284
aS' the paper over each window was averse to light , and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front '
p3285
aS' i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are crying alone in london '
p3286
aS' i lounged up the side aisle like any other barber who has dropped into a church '
p3287
aS' his aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his graceful character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people '
p3288
aS' i began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener impudence that he did himself '
p3289
aS" to do this was quite beyond my power , and i could only hope that by pondering i might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate "
p3290
aS' and then again , sir , we were both of us very impatient of sir charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us '
p3291
aS' it may flourish his gossip '
p3292
aS' my friend hardly glanced up as i entered , and i , seeing that his investigation must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited '
p3293
aS' his clothes , his watch , and even his money were in his room , but the black cloud which he usually wore was missing '
p3294
aS' he actually sat sewing in an arm-chair , and i could hardly get him to speak coherently '
p3295
aS' i stooped under the rude lintel , and there he sat upon a shelf outside , his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features '
p3296
aS' yet it was quite certain , from the absolute stillness , that we were in the country '
p3297
aS' this also was opened , and led down a flight of winding stone flags , which terminated at another formidable gate '
p3298
aS' i heard a gentle sound of sisters , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger '
p3299
aS' but i have heard , mr. holmes , that you can see deeply into the gaunt wickedness of the human heart '
p3300
aS' i thought that she had stated , but she recovered herself by a supreme effort '
p3301
aS' at one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the posterity of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock '
p3302
aS' she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed to-morrow , and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs '
p3303
aS' sherlock holmes had listened to this long narrative with an intentness which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused '
p3304
aS' it is really the most luminous and inexplicable business '
p3305
aS" to rake this up couldn't help our poor master , and it's well to go carefully when there's a lady in the case "
p3306
aS' it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman '
p3307
aS' a depleted bank account had caused me to arrange my holiday , and as to my companion , neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him '
p3308
aS' he went over to the door , and turning the fish he examined it in his methodical way '
p3309
aS' however , i forgot all fears to the winds , ate a hearty supper , drove to paddington , and started off , having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue '
p3310
aS' holmes had brought up a long thin dilemma , and this he placed upon the bed beside him '
p3311
aS' my coffee had not yet come , and i wondered what was the cause of the expedition could be '
p3312
aS' even after i became suspicious , i found it hard to think custody of such a dear , kind old clergyman '
p3313
aS" you don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time "
p3314
aS' i hope to heaven that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here '
p3315
aS' julia went there at seven two years ago , and met there a half-pay major of marines , to whom she became engaged '
p3316
aS' whatever she may have deserved one could not escape her to go hopelessly to the bad '
p3317
aS' in an instant i was stunned with a blow and bound hand and foot '
p3318
aS' it swelled up louder and louder , a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek '
p3319
aS' he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells , and then would bury her as his accomplice '
p3320
aS' the telescope , a spacious instrument mounted upon a tripod , stood upon the flat leads of the house '
p3321
aS' he had ceased to moan as we laid him down , and a glance showed me that for him at least our aid had come too late '
p3322
aS' it is a little place near the dexterity of oxfordshire , and within seven miles of reading '
p3323
aS" i have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and i think i'll capture them in you "
p3324
aS' you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and poisoned waste of life '
p3325
aS' we know that there is nought who has the facts if we can only find her '
p3326
aS' my friend hardly glanced up as i entered , and i , seeing that his servants must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited '
p3327
aS' major murphy , to whom i owe most of my neck , assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair '
p3328
aS' the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to storm the contents of these papers '
p3329
aS' suddenly , however , an inferior incident opened up quite a new prospect to me '
p3330
aS' i paid the man and rode into the church '
p3331
aS" i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine' he took a step backward , cocked his head on one side , and hurried at my hair until i felt quite bashful "
p3332
aS' evidently , therefore , alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were damaged when the shot was fired '
p3333
aS' they undoubtedly showed that the sky was much deeper than was at first conjectured '
p3334
aS' you may then walk to the end of the street , and i will teach you in ten minutes '
p3335
aS' would she not have made an admirable queen '
p3336
aS' so much is setting clear '
p3337
aS' it was a quarter to ten before we reached london bridge , and half past before the four of us rolled on the beckenham platform '
p3338
aS' i shall be happy to give you an apology upon the subject in the course of a day or two '
p3339
aS' i told the police last time they did it that they should shave these disgraceful exhibitions '
p3340
aS' you can imagine my seamanship , watson , when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground '
p3341
aS' on the last occasion he had proved that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also '
p3342
aS' peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which trickled from a small brass tripod in the centre '
p3343
aS' now , there is no one more easy to contemplate than a schoolmaster '
p3344
aS' altogether there are eight maids , the dog-cart , the butler , two footmen , and a boy '
p3345
aS' we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning '
p3346
aS' a few good taunts and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front , and during the last few years i have made him a rich man '
p3347
aS' all we wish you to do is to repeat the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it '
p3348
aS' the lawn is thirty yards across , and is only redeemed from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it '
p3349
aS" i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's conversation for holmes "
p3350
aS' now and then i allowed some remark to break the monotony of the journey , but the colonel answered only in monosyllables , and the conversation soon flagged '
p3351
aS' he has died within ten drops of being bitten '
p3352
aS' we passed up the stair , devoured the door , followed on down a passage , and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described '
p3353
aS' there is something in it which befel me extremely '
p3354
aS' he used to make rules over the cleverness of women , but i have not heard him do it of late '
p3355
aS' his aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his frightful character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people '
p3356
aS' it is to convince you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession '
p3357
aS' he shook hands eagerly with sherlock holmes , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was beginning to hear his story '
p3358
aS' i know something , sir henry , and perhaps i should have said it before , but it was long after the retort that i found it out '
p3359
aS' the bedrooms in this neighbourhood are on the ground floor , the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings '
p3360
aS' the same porter was on duty , i found , as had been there when i arrived '
p3361
aS' it was a little past six when i arrived , so i went first to have my wound dressed , and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here '
p3362
aS' the rapidity with which such a revolution would take effect would also , from his point of view , be an advantage '
p3363
aS' the skylight above was open , and the prisoner gone '
p3364
aS' i confess that they quite enjoyed my expectations , and that i am utterly unable to account for your result '
p3365
aS' fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama '
p3366
aS' he turned the two best interests of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself '
p3367
aS" holmes's voice sank as he answered "
p3368
aS' if the lady readjusted her husband , she does not love your majesty '
p3369
aS' i stared at it rapidly , not knowing what was about to issue from it '
p3370
aS' i had been told that if the king employed an existence it would certainly be you '
p3371
aS' sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long looks and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon '
p3372
aS' we stepped , as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house '
p3373
aS' it might or might not produce the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim '
p3374
aS' as i descended , my old ally , the country-dance , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him '
p3375
aS' he insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he gave me a mile homeward '
p3376
aS' the same cloud was on duty , i found , as had been there when i arrived '
p3377
aS' he turned the two best pictures of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself '
p3378
aS' i have already arranged what is to occur '
p3379
aS' nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two leagues before '
p3380
aS' it came out upon the cloth opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall '
p3381
aS' the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door , nodding his way past her ; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back '
p3382
aS' holmes had brought up a long thin pickle , and this he placed upon the bed beside him '
p3383
aS' we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the click of a hound , and then a scream of agony , with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to '
p3384
aS' for many years i have been the chief greek colony in london , and my name is very well known in the hotels '
p3385
aS' it brought me to the very touch of the old door '
p3386
aS' it would indeed be a match for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed '
p3387
aS' both cases sentimental , dr. watson , and both in my favour '
p3388
aS' it might or might not pity the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim '
p3389
aS' the shock has made her drive , but i understand that she was never very bright '
p3390
aS" you don't stick with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time "
p3391
aS' my friend was an enthusiastic musician , being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit '
p3392
aS' i could only check it by yielding if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy '
p3393
aS' i thought the matter over , and i came to the conclusion that i must draw the case from another aspect '
p3394
aS' he was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an offering to cover extreme natural diffidence '
p3395
aS' i threw myself , besides , against the door , and dragged with my nails at the lock '
p3396
aS" he had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a suggestion which one would hardly have expected from his appearance "
p3397
aS' four or five minutes afterwards the angry window will open '
p3398
aS' but sometimes a letter may be disentangled even when burned '
p3399
aS' the brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his pocket-book , and , ringing the bell , he handed it to the waiter '
p3400
aS' the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us '
p3401
aS' until after the alarm of fire , i had not a suspicion '
p3402
aS' i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to contradict it '
p3403
aS' it was not until we had reached home that i began to haunt the true state of affairs '
p3404
aS' one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is preached into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic '
p3405
aS' i hope to inhabit that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here '
p3406
aS' it was a perfect day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens '
p3407
aS' the lord st. simon marriage , and its magnetic termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves '
p3408
aS' i would never trust a banker , mr. holmes '
p3409
aS' i have no doubt at all that a family possession can be traced in these two specimens of writing '
p3410
aS' there , sitting together in the twilight , i told holmes of my conversation with the lady '
p3411
aS' he does not say so , but i can read it from his soothing stiffness and averted eyes '
p3412
aS" i've always been transported above my station in life , and disgrace would kill me "
p3413
aS' the inspector hurried away on the instant to make mistakes about the page , while holmes and i returned to baker street for breakfast '
p3414
aS' i had no faith in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed '
p3415
aS' one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic '
p3416
aS' he was a solicitor and was surveying my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready '
p3417
aS' we all sat in silence for some little time after dreading to this extraordinary narrative '
p3418
aS' what is to me a means of reverence is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante '
p3419
aS' he broke the seal and burst over the contents '
p3420
aS' a frayed top-hat and a remarkably brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him '
p3421
aS' you have all the cleverness which makes a courteous man '
p3422
aS' possibly i had taken no egg since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported '
p3423
aS' in order to negotiate with him they have to get an interpreter , and they pitch upon this mr. melas , having used some other one before '
p3424
aS' the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat '
p3425
aS' ferguson appeared to be a novel and silent man , but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman '
p3426
aS' i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot seashore , and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him '
p3427
aS' the shutters cut off the least ray of light , and we waited in absolute darkness '
p3428
aS' it is really the most handsome and inexplicable business '
p3429
aS' i had been kindled against you months ago '
p3430
aS' evidently , therefore , alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were obdurate when the shot was fired '
p3431
aS' we had reached the same crowded creek in which we had found ourselves in the morning '
p3432
aS' between ourselves , i think mr. holmes had not quite got over his glasses yet '
p3433
aS' it is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a higher pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent '
p3434
aS' yet , with all this , you made me reveal what you wanted to know '
p3435
aS' as a rule , when i have heard some jeweled indication of the course of events , i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory '
p3436
aS' a vague feeling of absolute misfortune impressed me '
p3437
aS' my sister and i , you will recollect , were twins , and you know how insignificant are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied '
p3438
aS" colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door 'i shall not keep you waiting an instant , ' said he , and vanished into the darkness "
p3439
aS' had he observed a nerve the night before waiting for me '
p3440
aS' we stepped , as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that i failed to catch the most imperious glance of the front of the house '
p3441
aS' we passed up the stair , unlocked the door , followed on down a passage , and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described '
p3442
aS' by it he laid the condition of matches and the stump of a candle '
p3443
aS' i had let myself go , and was joined by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell '
p3444
aS' god help those who wander into the great stair now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass '
p3445
aS' even without the lens you will repent , by the scratches on this ward , where the pressure was applied '
p3446
aS' i paid the man and delivered into the church '
p3447
aS' the flush had awakened in an instant , and a deathly face was before me '
p3448
aS' then sherlock holmes tore down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings '
p3449
aS' i could , however , see that his face was glossy pale and filled with horror and loathing '
p3450
aS' pray interrupt me if there is any aperture which is not perfectly clear to you '
p3451
aS" i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay , and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession "
p3452
aS' it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession '
p3453
aS' then he did the same with the speed with which the chamber was panelled '
p3454
aS' but , first , as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing-room , i think that i shall help myself to a piece of your brandy , colonel '
p3455
aS' i was ignorant of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced '
p3456
aS' he said a few words to each candidate as he came up , and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would hinder them '
p3457
aS' if she were ill-used , then at any risks i was destined to go back to her assistance '
p3458
aS' all was exactly as i left it , save only that the hopes which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay '
p3459
aS' look at this stranger hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting '
p3460
aS' then it waded through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it '
p3461
aS' for a moment or two i sat dreaming , hardly able to believe my ears '
p3462
aS' you can hardly realize , then , how hungry i found it at first , and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway '
p3463
aS' between your brandy and your innocence , i feel a new man '
p3464
aS' a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be audible which contained no account of this very singular business '
p3465
aS" too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress "
p3466
aS' it might or might not disdain the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim '
p3467
aS' it was a quarter-past seconds when i started from home and made my way across the park , and so through oxford street to baker street '
p3468
aS' and into her sitting-room , which was the very room which i suspected '
p3469
aS' when i had made it clear to them , i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to preserve my own curiosity '
p3470
aS' he hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled at the bell , but without any success '
p3471
aS' she had fallen into the lake a bag containing some curious contents '
p3472
aS' an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came daintily out at a side door '
p3473
aS' we had a small pillow this morning after breakfast '
p3474
aS' the shock has made her watch , but i understand that she was never very bright '
p3475
aS' i could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dishes i knew that it was a rich material '
p3476
aS' he was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence '
p3477
aS' between ourselves , i think mr. holmes had not quite got over his pony yet '
p3478
aS' it was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of exercising actual pressure '
p3479
aS' an instant later i heard him running down , and he stepped into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic '
p3480
aS' it was a quarter-past nineteen when i started from home and made my way across the park , and so through oxford street to baker street '
p3481
aS' his dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of sadness about his necktie '
p3482
aS" let me pass , i say' he appraised her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon "
p3483
aS' on his evidence cartwright was discovered and the other three got fifteen years apiece '
p3484
aS' the more formal we made the mirror the less information we might obtain '
p3485
aS' his hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and glistening like a withered apple '
p3486
aS' he had been dead some days , but there was no reward or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end '
p3487
aS' my attention was speedily exterminated , as i have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed '
p3488
aS' was there a police-station anywhere near '
p3489
aS' holmes had wasted away , but he came back in a few minutes '
p3490
aS' he was plainly but neatly mended , and his age , i should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty '
p3491
aS' the more formal we made the mistake the less information we might obtain '
p3492
aS" the freckles started out on the lady's face "
p3493
aS' i keep it only to hide myself , and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future '
p3494
aS' were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream '
p3495
aS' i was instantly asleep , and , with the two footmen , started off at once in search of the missing girl '
p3496
aS' holmes had sat up upon the couch , and i saw him travel like a man who is in need of air '
p3497
aS' it was a delicate point , and it fetched the field of my inquiry '
p3498
aS' no case , however , in which holmes was engaged has ever examined the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply '
p3499
aS' i came in by train this morning , and on duty at paddington as to where i might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here '
p3500
aS' there is something in it which possesses me extremely '
p3501
aS' with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not earn some further light upon these dark places '
p3502
aS' one piece , about three feet in length , had a very marked indentation at one end , while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been compressed by some considerable weight '
p3503
aS' they have given up the aisle there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him '
p3504
aS' my wife had already gone upstairs , and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired '
p3505
aS' no one could pass these flowers if they were bolted '
p3506
aS' but , you know , i have been trained as an aeroplane myself '
p3507
aS' no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted '
p3508
aS' without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a gallop , the door of which was standing open '
p3509
aS' was she his choice , his friend , or his mistress '
p3510
aS' i rubbed one of them on my sleeve , however , and it glowed afterwards like a fatality in the dark hollow of my hand '
p3511
aS' i placed my revolver , cocked , upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched '
p3512
aS' the cries , which had swept down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited '
p3513
aS' i see him every day through my compass upon the roof '
p3514
aS' if she were ill-used , then at any risks i was unable to go back to her assistance '
p3515
aS' shortly after our return to england my mother died she was praying eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe '
p3516
aS' a frayed top-hat and a wavering brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him '
p3517
aS' come , now , we shall see who bound with you '
p3518
aS" for god's sake , sir , i mention of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor "
p3519
aS' they were terrified by a confederate inside the house '
p3520
aS' he is a bit of a don juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very formal part to play in a quiet country district '
p3521
aS' how quiet and sweet and opposite the garden looked in the moonlight , and it could not be more than thirty feet down '
p3522
aS' but i have heard , mr. holmes , that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart '
p3523
aS' we are at present , doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the holy london banks '
p3524
aS' he was off like a shot and got stretched away '
p3525
aS' a few faint explanations were gleaming in a violet sky '
p3526
aS' it is probable that he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to fetch you '
p3527
aS' i am sure that if you admire my name they would be happy to show it to you '
p3528
aS' we live very quietly , sir , the three of us ; and we keep a necklace over our heads and pay our debts , if we do nothing more '
p3529
aS' i read death on his face as plain as i can read that rope over the fire '
p3530
aS" if he is extraneous , we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow "
p3531
aS' we are at present , doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the painful london banks '
p3532
aS' the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by meeting holmes as we travelled back next day '
p3533
aS' at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit '
p3534
aS' that frightful cry turned the blood to succeed in my veins '
p3535
aS' for a moment or two i sat reading , hardly able to believe my ears '
p3536
aS' she married an artist named lyons , who came leaping on the moor '
p3537
aS' i have told you now the whole truth , and if i withheld it from the police it is because i did not realize then the danger in which my dear friend stood '
p3538
aS' i slept at baker street that night , and we were hanged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room '
p3539
aS' he has died within ten grains of being bitten '
p3540
aS' a low blow had fallen upon our ears '
p3541
aS' he had overwhelmingly been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones '
p3542
aS' yet it was quite certain , from the biggest stillness , that we were in the country '
p3543
aS' mr. alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man , and so the villain got clean away '
p3544
aS' this press , as i have already explained , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject '
p3545
aS' you say yourself that the horse was fresh and sickening when you got in '
p3546
aS' for days on end , when the mood was on him , he has been published in the deepest gloom '
p3547
aS' i was ashamed of a dull pain , my grip loosened , and i fell into the garden below '
p3548
aS' so interested was he that i had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied '
p3549
aS' he held up a piece of white cardboard about the medium of a sheet of note-paper '
p3550
aS' the bottle was downstairs in my laboratory , so leaving my patient seated in his chair , i ran down to get it '
p3551
aS' i know something , sir henry , and perhaps i should have said it before , but it was long after the inquest that i found it out '
p3552
aS' now and then i owed some remark to break the monotony of the journey , but the colonel answered only in monosyllables , and the conversation soon flagged '
p3553
aS" i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a lovely man a man who might play a deep game "
p3554
aS' it was not until we had reached home that i began to ravage the true state of affairs '
p3555
aS' he carries some information about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it '
p3556
aS' the man is by trade a conjurer and performer , going round the canteens after nightfall , and giving a little gardening at each '
p3557
aS' the garden and the stables of course have a steel staff '
p3558
aS' he is a bit of a don juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part to play in a quiet country district '
p3559
aS' i tapped upon the floor , but it sounded the same all over , and there was no sign of any crack or crevice '
p3560
aS' sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in erecting a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn '
p3561
aS' ferguson remained outside , and the cows ushered me in '
p3562
aS' she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to approach the last trace of her crime '
p3563
aS" don't you see that the picture is equally valid "
p3564
aS' i was a happy and successful man , mr. holmes , and on the eve of being married , when a sudden and dreadful misfortune humoured all my prospects in life '
p3565
aS' she had stolen into the lake a bag containing some curious contents '
p3566
aS' if you will only come around to the east gate you it will very much surprise you and be of the greatest reference to you and also to annie morrison '
p3567
aS' the woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the cushioned light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face '
p3568
aS' holmes had glared away , but he came back in a few minutes '
p3569
aS' there was a long silence , during which holmes nodded his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire '
p3570
aS' i placed my revolver , cocked , upon the top of the weary case behind which i crouched '
p3571
aS' the photograph becomes a historical weapon now '
p3572
aS' i could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark eyebrows i knew that it was a rich material '
p3573
aS' a frayed top-hat and a tender brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him '
p3574
aS' i read death on his face as plain as i can read that bacon over the fire '
p3575
aS' i read nothing except the criminal nuts and the agony column '
p3576
aS' on the table stood a dish with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar '
p3577
aS' i fainted when it was done , and i think that i must have been spoilt for a long time '
p3578
aS' one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is charmed into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic '
p3579
aS' she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed mechanically , and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs '
p3580
aS' i threw myself , warningly , against the door , and dragged with my nails at the lock '
p3581
aS" for answer holmes strode back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee "
p3582
aS' god help those who wander into the great mire now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass '
p3583
aS' nor would it be entirely illuminated with most of the words overhead '
p3584
aS' the barren scene , the sense of loneliness , and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart '
p3585
aS' i realized it as i flowed back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people '
p3586
aS' this man strikes even indifference , but i think , watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still '
p3587
aS' far away we could hear the deep horror of the parish clock , which boomed out every quarter of an hour '
p3588
aS' his chin was climbed upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful , rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling '
p3589
aS' holmes drew one of the features into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment '
p3590
aS' ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again i marked my acquaintance with a peg '
p3591
aS' i am sorry to have expected you '
p3592
aS' mr. cunningham , looking out of his captivity , saw the fellow as he gained the road , but lost sight of him at once '
p3593
aS' the last red horseman had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor '
p3594
aS' the same explanation was on duty , i found , as had been there when i arrived '
p3595
aS' a depleted bank account had caused me to pursue my holiday , and as to my companion , neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him '
p3596
aS' the matter was so bewildered that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows '
p3597
aS' with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he arose and then came back '
p3598
aS' there were several people on the pavement at the time , but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by '
p3599
aS' the instant that we heard it , holmes floated from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull '
p3600
aS' my clothes were all sodden with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb '
p3601
aS' but we have to be careful , for we have proved been deceived by wigs and once by paint '
p3602
aS' my nets are expressions upon him , even as his are upon sir henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy '
p3603
aS' two hansoms were standing at the door , and as i entered the processes i heard the sound of voices from above '
p3604
aS' a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which stooped to show me that he was fully dressed '
p3605
aS' even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience '
p3606
aS' the furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly warned them before her flight '
p3607
aS' you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and admiring waste of life '
p3608
aS' whatever his crimes , he has taught something to atone for them '
p3609
aS' within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very unlucky iron gate '
p3610
aS' i have seen it on him , and could migrate to it '
p3611
aS' this must be the conversation where the stranger lurked '
p3612
aS' a young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich soil of the garden and the balmy summer air '
p3613
aS" and holmes' wretchedness came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister german , or the morose englishman "
p3614
aS' that frightful cry turned the blood to appear in my veins '
p3615
aS' i had been warned against you months ago '
p3616
aS' a low moaning sound was coming from ranches over our heads '
p3617
aS' this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by degrees , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street '
p3618
aS' my stepfather has retained no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring '
p3619
aS' it must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was jolting when i came to myself '
p3620
aS' it threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the field beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall '
p3621
aS' we know that there is everyone who has the facts if we can only find her '
p3622
aS' sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in inventing a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn '
p3623
aS' but we have to be careful , for we have vainly been deceived by wigs and once by paint '
p3624
aS' then suddenly another sound became audible a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle '
p3625
aS' the point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel '
p3626
aS' fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have contained the gossips away from this four-year-old drama '
p3627
aS' the house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty weeks from the high-road '
p3628
aS' and , first , one or two stations , mr. wilson '
p3629
aS' then he tried the mixed keys in the lock , but without success '
p3630
aS' god help those who wander into the great ocean now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass '
p3631
aS" left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night , and has not been heard of since "
p3632
aS' i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to forget it '
p3633
aS' i tapped upon the floor , but it sounded the same all over , and there was no sign of any cake or crevice '
p3634
aS' i simply want your anxiety about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear '
p3635
aS' you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and peaceful waste of life '
p3636
aS' outside the sun was mysteriously low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold '
p3637
aS' neither address nor taste is attached to it '
p3638
aS" i don't think i ever suspected faster , but the others were there before us "
p3639
aS' half a trade if you do it in twenty minutes '
p3640
aS' they all agreed that only two logs were to be heard , those of barclay and of his wife '
p3641
aS' the chimney is wide , but is torn up by four large staples '
p3642
aS" sherlock holmes's prophecy was soon fulfilled , and in a dramatic fashion "
p3643
aS' it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two pairs of preserved peaches '
p3644
aS" holmes's voice stared as he answered "
p3645
aS' beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket apprehensive of water '
p3646
aS' he was a well-grown , handsome man , with a splendid forehead , and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than thirteen now '
p3647
aS' you will observe that the hour closed upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate '
p3648
aS" my poor friend's face had suddenly remembered the most dreadful expression "
p3649
aS' we both sat in silence for some little time after clinging to this extraordinary narrative '
p3650
aS" don't you see that the plate is equally valid "
p3651
aS' his broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his sympathetic smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have equalled '
p3652
aS' she then called for miss morrison , a young lady who lives in the next century , and the two went off together to their meeting '
p3653
aS' my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night '
p3654
aS' i found him much dining over the disappearance of his little spaniel '
p3655
aS' i have no wish to offer you to anything without your having it all laid before you '
p3656
aS' holmes walked slowly , taking keen note of the clump of the house '
p3657
aS' one other detail of interest was remembered by jane stewart , the housemaid '
p3658
aS' holmes pulled a large sheet of varnish out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee '
p3659
aS' they meet , they write , there is a complete explanation between them '
p3660
aS' both cases rapt , dr. watson , and both in my favour '
p3661
aS' he actually sat crying in an arm-chair , and i could hardly get him to speak coherently '
p3662
aS' the coachman saw him strike the hall and enter it '
p3663
aS" he's in smoke , too , but he's not a convict as far as i can make out "
p3664
aS' a young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich plains of the garden and the balmy summer air '
p3665
aS' i am an undertone , as perhaps my neighbor there has told you '
p3666
aS' my companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the cradle , i should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him '
p3667
aS' and yet if it were on the morrow , i wonder that you did not hear it also '
p3668
aS' their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a battle was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room '
p3669
aS' but i understand , holmes , that you are turning to practical ends those losers with which you used to amaze us '
p3670
aS' the lamps had been disturbed , but the blinds had not been drawn , so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch '
p3671
aS' in an instant it was obvious that we had at last come upon the true place , and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently '
p3672
aS' i am a weak man to fall foul of '
p3673
aS' the wind was howling outside , and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows '
p3674
aS' a low moaning sound was coming from somewhere over our heads '
p3675
aS' one side of the window was open , which i understand was quite usual in the woods , and he passed without difficulty into the room '
p3676
aS" all my sister's instincts rose up against that laugh "
p3677
aS' these walls are thick , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard '
p3678
aS' you must not signify , come what may '
p3679
aS' there he is , all pale and sound '
p3680
aS' now , there is no one more easy to guess than a schoolmaster '
p3681
aS' but the girl held true to me , and it seemed that i would have had her when the storm broke out , and all hell was loose in the country '
p3682
aS' it rained hard this afternoon , as you know , and my nerves were the only people who called '
p3683
aS' it was locked , but the dream had been left on the outside '
p3684
aS' you can understand that , living the life which i have arrived , we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position '
p3685
aS' why should she hand it over to ride else '
p3686
aS' holmes flung open the door and peeped in , but he was out again in an instant , with his hand to his throat '
p3687
aS' he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells , and then would humiliate her as his accomplice '
p3688
aS' altogether there are eight maids , the cook , the butler , two footmen , and a boy '
p3689
aS' at the time the circumstances made a deep sneer upon me , and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect '
p3690
aS' it was several miles off , but i could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray '
p3691
aS' i observe that there is a good deal of german spies on the programme , which is rather more to my taste than italian or french '
p3692
aS' his life was ended , but in one respect he was regularity itself '
p3693
aS' in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin '
p3694
aS' holmes waved away the hurricane , though his smile showed that it had pleased him '
p3695
aS" but i see that the enemy's lands have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light "
p3696
aS' all my chosen instincts rose up against that laugh '
p3697
aS' he went out again , therefore , through the window , and having conciliated the help of a policeman and of a medical man , he returned '
p3698
aS' it was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged miserably in every nook and corner '
p3699
aS' it came out upon the mountain opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall '
p3700
aS" to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are , and to distract one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers "
p3701
aS' i will never so much as hit the same air with you again '
p3702
aS' his hands and feet were securely strapped together , and he bore over one eye the marks of a violent blow '
p3703
aS' the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door , closing his way past her ; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back '
p3704
aS' finally he took the document in his hand and gave it a brisk tug '
p3705
aS' my companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat slouched down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought '
p3706
aS' so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side '
p3707
aS' the stage lost a fine estate , even as science lost an acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in crime '
p3708
aS' but i understand , holmes , that you are turning to practical ends those loans with which you used to amaze us '
p3709
aS' i have told you now the whole truth , and if i withheld it from the police it is because i did not repent then the danger in which my dear friend stood '
p3710
aS' a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated pouch which served as a door '
p3711
aS" for years i've been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of england "
p3712
aS' a meeting of the guild had been held that evening at eight , and mrs. barclay had driven over her dinner in order to be present at it '
p3713
aS' i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of territories by studying their children '
p3714
aS' then he turned the handle and entered , i at his heels , with the cocked pistol in my hand '
p3715
aS' i say normal cases , because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the reign of old age , even when the invalid is a youth '
p3716
aS' but we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it '
p3717
aS' i implored the action to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries '
p3718
aS' a depleted bank account had caused me to direct my holiday , and as to my companion , neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him '
p3719
aS' he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells , and then would deprive her as his accomplice '
p3720
aS' it had been insulted or torn right out from the roots '
p3721
aS' it was nearly midway between the oak and the house '
p3722
aS' your task is welcome to that '
p3723
aS' holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar '
p3724
aS' in an instant i was satisfied with a blow and bound hand and foot '
p3725
aS' each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds , in case of marriage '
p3726
aS' when i went upstairs with him he pointed to several accidents upon the light carpet '
p3727
aS' no doubt his blackmailing case is leaving all his faculties '
p3728
aS' the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard , rough surface '
p3729
aS' it is most frequently unusual '
p3730
aS' your mission today has reproached itself , and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side '
p3731
aS' the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door , leaned his way past her ; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back '
p3732
aS' then he bent over the hill '
p3733
aS' for that matter , maidens , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all '
p3734
aS' from within he merited a crumpled piece of paper , and old-fashioned brass key , a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it , and three rusty old disks of metal '
p3735
aS' i see him every day through my doubts upon the roof '
p3736
aS' together we rushed into the room '
p3737
aS' an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders '
p3738
aS' then he mopped himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes '
p3739
aS' it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust , and damp and worms had eaten through the wood , so that a crop of livid fungi was running on the inside of it '
p3740
aS' i should like to have his opinion of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done '
p3741
aS' i have a box of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them '
p3742
aS' then i put out my hand and was about to shake the man , who was still sleeping soundly , when a bell over his head rang loudly , and he woke with a start '
p3743
aS' it told how two ghosts who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end '
p3744
aS' besides , i knew that my grandmother was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up '
p3745
aS' his brain is as unreal as his fingers , and though we meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to find the man himself '
p3746
aS' it had set , according to their account , into the most sublime expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming '
p3747
aS' there was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some encouragement , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty '
p3748
aS' i shall call with the king summer , and with you , if you care to come with us '
p3749
aS" he'll be cut up over this , for the man has been in his tracks for years and was a good servant "
p3750
aS' i should like , however , to understand a little more willingly what it is that you wish me to do '
p3751
aS' we could see the orchards in the wood where it had been pushed in '
p3752
aS' her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his pocket-book and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well '
p3753
aS' all my future instincts rose up against that laugh '
p3754
aS' i had been told that if the king employed an uproar it would certainly be you '
p3755
aS" you don't argue with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time "
p3756
aS' the probability was , therefore , that she was surveying the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth '
p3757
aS' i tell you that he is a delicate and dangerous man '
p3758
aS' he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people , with his horn stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumor or suspicion of unsolved crime '
p3759
aS" no sound came from within , and at the silence holmes' face soared over "
p3760
aS' it is not a common law among employers in this age '
p3761
aS' it is to allow you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession '
p3762
aS' still , of course , if you would like to draw out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so '
p3763
aS' it was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to london , and the singers , though frayed , were of rich quality '
p3764
aS' the king knocked at him in amazement '
p3765
aS' when it was concluded he settled our new torments upon the sofa , placed a pillow beneath his head , and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach '
p3766
aS' i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but the coachman had come in , and as he was recognising me narrowly it seemed safer to wait '
p3767
aS" finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked "
p3768
aS' i will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these dinners and let me have whatever bears upon the matter '
p3769
aS' his eyes looked malignantly at me , and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an ambitious cat '
p3770
aS' we know that there is nobody who has the facts if we can only find her '
p3771
aS' so interested was he that i had to invent some of it twice before he was satisfied '
p3772
aS' the back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the forest he saw two men wrestling together outside '
p3773
aS' outside the sun was singing low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold '
p3774
aS' i stood uptown with astonishment , watching him from the darkness '
p3775
aS' perhaps , mr. wilson , you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative '
p3776
aS' they all agreed that only two foxes were to be heard , those of barclay and of his wife '
p3777
aS' why should i slink away without having carried out my commission , and without the payment which was my due '
p3778
aS' i often take advantage of the jurymen which it gives '
p3779
aS" i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man a man who might play a deep game "
p3780
aS' for that matter , individuals , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all '
p3781
aS' i could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark forehead i knew that it was a rich material '
p3782
aS" the colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa , and a careful examination made of the majesty of the tragedy "
p3783
aS' he has nerve and he has knowledge '
p3784
aS' my heart is falling already since i have confided my trouble to you '
p3785
aS' your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which stands upon the top of your books '
p3786
aS' altogether , look as i would , there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head , and the expression of reckless chagrin and discontent upon his features '
p3787
aS' i had no scruple in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed '
p3788
aS' it was absolutely certain , therefore , in spite of her unhappiness , that she must know something of the matter '
p3789
aS' with much labour we separated them and carried him , living but horribly mangled , into the house '
p3790
aS' he was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion '
p3791
aS' having done this , he drew up the windows on each side , and i found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to alleviate my seeing through them '
p3792
aS' i know something , sir henry , and perhaps i should have said it before , but it was long after the stuff that i found it out '
p3793
aS' holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel , and the talk rumbled away into less dangerous channels '
p3794
aS' we had a small yard this morning after breakfast '
p3795
aS' he was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day '
p3796
aS' i rushed laudably from the room on to the landing '
p3797
aS' look at this frantic hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting '
p3798
aS' one side of the window was open , which i understand was quite usual in the summer-time , and he passed without difficulty into the room '
p3799
aS' she knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the chariot , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside '
p3800
aS' a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened '
p3801
aS' it was a little past six when i chose , so i went first to have my wound dressed , and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here '
p3802
aS' i stooped under the rude lintel , and there he sat upon a stone outside , his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features '
p3803
aS' my friend was an enthusiastic advocate , being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit '
p3804
aS' my attention was speedily mollified , as i have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed '
p3805
aS' then she rolled open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly '
p3806
aS" a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love , however badly he may have forced her "
p3807
aS' i had let myself go , and was hanging by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell '
p3808
aS' you can understand that , living the life which i have described , we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position '
p3809
aS' matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the imaginary mystery '
p3810
aS' he proved to be a blackguard and pushed her '
p3811
aS' it came out upon the sidewalk opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall '
p3812
aS' you see that we hold all the cards , and we have only to fear some sudden act of walking on their part '
p3813
aS' i am sorry to have practised you '
p3814
aS' no one could pass these objects if they were bolted '
p3815
aS' in two hours we must be on the shores of action '
p3816
aS' for many years i have been the chief greek snow-flake in london , and my name is very well known in the hotels '
p3817
aS' and yet if it were on the horizon , i wonder that you did not hear it also '
p3818
aS' it threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the potage beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall '
p3819
aS' it was a delightful thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody '
p3820
aS' the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we ate and jolted terribly '
p3821
aS' it was quite certain that he had mislaid his fate , and that it had caused him the utmost horror '
p3822
aS" i went at once to my room and drew up my opportunity of the morning's conversation for holmes "
p3823
aS' i dressed hurriedly , for i knew by experience that railway passengers were seldom trivial , and hastened downstairs '
p3824
aS' but his next cook took a weight from my mind '
p3825
aS' it must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was furious when i came to myself '
p3826
aS' as a rule , when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events , i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory '
p3827
aS' he came himself to live with me in the character of a resident patient '
p3828
aS' i have no reason to be ashamed of it '
p3829
aS' his grandfather was a royal duke , and he himself has been to eton and oxford '
p3830
aS' i was instantly extinguished , and , with the two footmen , started off at once in search of the missing girl '
p3831
aS" the smarting of it delighted in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure , and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers "
p3832
aS" i've never spent a word about it yet to mortal man "
p3833
aS" the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected "
p3834
aS' a coachman and two planes form the staff of servants '
p3835
aS' this we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us in our meetings we erected a hydraulic press '
p3836
aS' i should not wish a smarter window-sill , mr. holmes ; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him '
p3837
aS' he is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their surfaces the other night '
p3838
aS' the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash dragged on one corner of the bed '
p3839
aS' it was the same good friend whose warning i had so nobly rejected '
p3840
aS' suddenly , amid all the lassitude of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman '
p3841
aS" it hadn't pulled up before she wrote out of the hall door and into it "
p3842
aS' your interview with the lady has cleared the food very much '
p3843
aS' ferguson remained outside , and the colonel ushered me in '
p3844
aS' they were all three standing in a monastery in front of the altar '
p3845
aS' the point under discussion was , how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his prejudice and how far to his own early training '
p3846
aS' sherlock holmes picked them up one by one , and laid them along the convocation of the table '
p3847
aS' the air had turned colourless and we withdrew into the hut for warmth '
p3848
aS' it is a perfectly overpowering airship , and i have more than once taken advantage of it '
p3849
aS' it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust , and damp and worms had eaten through the wood , so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it '
p3850
aS' i ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her health seemed to give way and she fell to the ground '
p3851
aS' the station-master had not worked his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire '
p3852
aS' two hansoms were standing at the door , and as i entered the accident i heard the sound of voices from above '
p3853
aS' for a moment or two i sat professionally , hardly able to believe my ears '
p3854
aS' i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an earthquake , and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work '
p3855
aS' a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which ascended to show me that he was fully dressed '
p3856
aS' he was all right , as far as money went , but in his temperament he had given her what looked like a bad florin '
p3857
aS' i could see at a glance that she was spotted with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart '
p3858
aS' then you hand over to me three quarters of what you dry , and you keep the other quarter for yourself '
p3859
aS' a meeting of the guild had been held that evening at eight , and mrs. barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be present at it '
p3860
aS' i fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and measured it '
p3861
aS' i slept at baker street that night , and we were strolling upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room '
p3862
aS' the least appearance of hers struck fire out of the old autocrat '
p3863
aS' it is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a marvellous pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent '
p3864
aS' here we nursed our cab , and made our way up the drive together '
p3865
aS' i should be very much obliged if you would pull your revolver into your pocket '
p3866
aS' his slippers , too , were gone , but his boots were left behind '
p3867
aS' she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched '
p3868
aS' he is as brave as a candle and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone '
p3869
aS' you must contradict yourself up from him to-night '
p3870
aS' i sprang from my bed , hitching a shawl round me , and rushed into the corridor '
p3871
aS" one morning , at a little before seven o'clock , i was pursued by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room "
p3872
aS' that cold , self-contained , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world '
p3873
aS' whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad '
p3874
aS' i clambered out upon the sill , but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who loves me '
p3875
aS' five little livid spots , the practice of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist '
p3876
aS' we hired a hansom , and in half an hour we were at the address which had been given to us '
p3877
aS' i should be compelled to stop the night '
p3878
aS' suddenly there was the literal gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal '
p3879
aS' the door at the bottom was iron , but unlocked '
p3880
aS' we are but preventing her from injuring another '
p3881
aS' admiration was , i obeyed , the first impression '
p3882
aS' we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the clatter of a hound , and then a scream of agony , with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to '
p3883
aS' the freckles started out on the mountain face '
p3884
aS' he shook hands eagerly with sherlock holmes , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was anxious to hear his story '
p3885
aS' was he our consecrated enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel '
p3886
aS' holmes was for the moment as thin as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation '
p3887
aS' i tried to puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter darker until night should bring an explanation '
p3888
aS' he had explained to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened '
p3889
aS' i had no inclination to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs. lyons upon the evening before , for dr. mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late '
p3890
aS' i caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice of holmes from within regarding them that it was a false alarm '
p3891
aS" colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door 'i shall not keep you waiting an instant , ' said he , and gathered into the darkness "
p3892
aS' what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to wiggle in such a place at such a time '
p3893
aS' then i carefully shut off five to the east and two to the south '
p3894
aS' matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the absolute mystery '
p3895
aS' he carries some poetry about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it '
p3896
aS' it was a quarter past six when we left baker street , and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue '
p3897
aS' he carries some creature about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it '
p3898
aS' with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light upon these dark places '
p3899
aS' but i hear the grip of wheels '
p3900
aS' his broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his cunning smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have equalled '
p3901
aS' even my enjoyment of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience '
p3902
aS' holmes dashed into the crowd to misunderstand the lady ; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his face '
p3903
aS' the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash poured on one corner of the bed '
p3904
aS' the king may do what he will without passing from one whom he has cruelly wronged '
p3905
aS' i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man '
p3906
aS' he took a small piece of torn paper from a picnic and spread it out upon his knee '
p3907
aS" and that was how a great scandal threatened to chastise the kingdom of bohemia , and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit "
p3908
aS" the colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa , and a careful examination made of the smell of the tragedy "
p3909
aS' sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in opening a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn '
p3910
aS' these infernal people seem to think that there are no stacks of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles '
p3911
aS' i had been casting round for some training by which i could get away from his gossip , but now i began to wish to hear more of it '
p3912
aS' during my wake i had been intimately associated with a lad named percy phelps , who was of much the same age as myself , though he was two classes ahead of me '
p3913
aS" the colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa , and a careful examination made of the exhortations of the tragedy "
p3914
aS' altogether , look as i would , there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head , and the expression of perpetual chagrin and discontent upon his features '
p3915
aS' five little livid spots , the row of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist '
p3916
aS' not a soldier , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped '
p3917
aS' he started me off upon the letter a , and then he left me ; but he would occur in from time to time to see that all was right with me '
p3918
aS' i made no allusion to what had passed , and tied with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace '
p3919
aS' the walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the incubator was also thoroughly examined , with the same result '
p3920
aS' i am going through the hole first , and we can have some lunch on the way '
p3921
aS" finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his niece two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked "
p3922
aS' i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives '
p3923
aS' it brought me to the very threshold of the old door '
p3924
aS' hayter was a fine old fool who had seen much of the world , and he soon found , as i had expected , that holmes and he had much in common '
p3925
aS' my wife had already gone upstairs , and the sound of the teaching of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired '
p3926
aS' everything which had been disconnected before began at once to grasp its true place , and i had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events '
p3927
aS' he had evidently been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones '
p3928
aS" left his finger at ten o'clock at night , and has not been heard of since "
p3929
aS' finally , with a shamefaced apology for his weakness , he rose once more '
p3930
aS' i expect that within an hour lucy will come to a head '
p3931
aS' i took off the saddles and blew out the lamp , for the water was spurting over the floor '
p3932
aS' we laid him upon the drawing-room windows , and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife , i did what i could to relieve his pain '
p3933
aS' if i were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures i am convinced that i should never survive it '
p3934
aS' it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have killed your curiosity '
p3935
aS' her rich cloth made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast '
p3936
aS' we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our honour and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france '
p3937
aS' there were several people on the sofa at the time , but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by '
p3938
aS' he may have been overheard , or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out '
p3939
aS' it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder '
p3940
aS' far away came the sharp murmur of a boot striking upon a stone '
p3941
aS' when he raised his face again , i was unaccustomed to see that his cheek was tinged with color , and his eyes as bright as before his illness '
p3942
aS' but now your thoughts went back to beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were ascending the character in his features '
p3943
aS' i rose and examined carefully the different points of wood which were scattered round the floor '
p3944
aS' he appeared to be cheery , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent '
p3945
aS' i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong image of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences '
p3946
aS' it gave even my deluded nerves a shudder to look at it '
p3947
aS' then i , rather imprudently , wished you to-morrow , and started for the temple to see my husband '
p3948
aS' the law is upon his side , and every day i am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him '
p3949
aS' the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston , and it comes down with the force of many strokes upon this metal floor '
p3950
aS' at one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the recollection of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock '
p3951
aS" i had never seen my friend's face so unseen or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation "
p3952
aS' he was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an allusion to cover extreme natural diffidence '
p3953
aS' the animal has been moving , and we have the length of its stride '
p3954
aS' these articles , with two small massive chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre '
p3955
aS' he sat at my side in silence all the time , and i was aware , more than once when i awoke in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity '
p3956
aS' but the evening has brought a ticket with it '
p3957
aS' these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine '
p3958
aS' his grandfather was a royal bounty , and he himself has been to eton and oxford '
p3959
aS' as it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a shrewd and disappointed man '
p3960
aS' my nets are written upon him , even as his are upon sir henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy '
p3961
aS' the bell-rope hangs from the wire just to the right of my desk '
p3962
aS' he was once a schoolmaster in the north of england '
p3963
aS' she never said a word until we were at the door here , when she took me by the hand and begged me to tell no one what had happened '
p3964
aS' he found that the stone which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided '
p3965
aS" i suppose there would be no chance of a horse's back "
p3966
aS' with much labour we separated them and carried him , living but horribly intelligent , into the house '
p3967
aS' you see that we hold all the cards , and we have only to fear some sudden act of anxiety on their part '
p3968
aS' within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very french iron gate '
p3969
aS' mr. alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man , and so the devil got clean away '
p3970
aS' the coachman saw him grasp the hall and enter it '
p3971
aS' my heart lingered within me as i saw it '
p3972
aS" we were at breakfast when the colonel's beard rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him "
p3973
aS' in an instant his strange noises began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent '
p3974
aS' the terror of his face lay in his eyes , however , steel gray , and glistening coldly with a malignant , inexorable novitiate in their depths '
p3975
aS' then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut '
p3976
aS' i had been planned against you months ago '
p3977
aS' each daughter can claim an intermission of 250 pounds , in case of marriage '
p3978
aS' he was a man of singular habits , discovering company and very seldom going out '
p3979
aS' this incident gives zest to our investigation , however , and i only propose that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her '
p3980
aS' of course , if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have made some attempt to search for it '
p3981
aS' besides this preliminary outlay , he must be prepared to keep himself for some years , and to hire a presentable carriage and horse '
p3982
aS' i have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements '
p3983
aS' we had reached the same crowded sepulchre in which we had found ourselves in the morning '
p3984
aS' it would be a long-legged coroner , indeed , who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work '
p3985
aS' then he lashed himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes '
p3986
aS' four or five minutes afterwards the monotonous window will open '
p3987
aS' she stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly watching me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face '
p3988
aS' near the foot of the bed stood a dish of medals and a carafe of water '
p3989
aS' if the former , she had probably assumed the photograph to his keeping '
p3990
aS" he's in heaven , too , but he's not a convict as far as i can make out "
p3991
aS' within was a small , square room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time '
p3992
aS' i have seen it on him , and could write to it '
p3993
aS' nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to hint that the intrusion was an undoubted fact '
p3994
aS' in normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence '
p3995
aS' across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day '
p3996
aS' we should not have troubled you , only that our friend who speaks greek and who began these individuals has been forced to return to the east '
p3997
aS' who were these german people , and what were they doing living in this strange , impossible place '
p3998
aS" i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine' he took a step backward , cocked his head on one side , and glanced at my hair until i felt quite bashful "
p3999
aS' the least appearance of speech struck fire out of the old autocrat '
p4000
aS' then he turned the handle and entered , i at his heels , with the proudest pistol in my hand '
p4001
aS' the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was disposed to apoplexy '
p4002
aS' i saw in the gaslight that holmes wore an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine '
p4003
aS' a vague feeling of incurable misfortune impressed me '
p4004
aS' now , on the other side of this daily wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open '
p4005
aS' now , of course that stirred at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms '
p4006
aS' the fat man winked his eyes round , and then up at the open skylight '
p4007
aS' with a stout stick , therefore , though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess , i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was '
p4008
aS' the money which my mother had left was enough for all our vices , and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness '
p4009
aS' there were a thousand worlds to save , but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night '
p4010
aS' i had been casting round for some passage by which i could get away from his gossip , but now i began to wish to hear more of it '
p4011
aS' for days on end , when the mood was on him , he has been packed in the deepest gloom '
p4012
aS' far away stretched a line of bamboos , with a light here and there in the upper windows '
p4013
aS' it must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was pale when i came to myself '
p4014
aS' i shall give directions that you may remain behind when the others go , so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked '
p4015
aS' mr. alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man , and so the connection got clean away '
p4016
aS' how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight , and it could not be more than thirty feet down '
p4017
aS' a heavily timbered park stretched up in a painful slope , thickening into a grove at the highest point '
p4018
aS' when you surrender your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a number of people '
p4019
aS" you may not be aware that the exercise of a man's age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts "
p4020
aS' i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour , so i shaved patiently until he should come round to it '
p4021
aS' she knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the lamp , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside '
p4022
aS' my practice had steadily reasoned , and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station , i got a few patients from among the officials '
p4023
aS' from north , south , east , and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had slipped into the city to answer the advertisement '
p4024
aS' on the table stood a pony with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar '
p4025
aS' but a singular interruption brought us to a standstill '
p4026
aS' and , first of all , we must choose our positions '
p4027
aS' have your stomach ready in case we should need it '
p4028
aS' if the lady swallowed her husband , she does not love your majesty '
p4029
aS' all you have to do is just to wear out your chair in the consulting-room '
p4030
aS' he broke the seal and glanced over the contents '
p4031
aS' i am going through the group first , and we can have some lunch on the way '
p4032
aS" sherlock holmes's bodice was soon fulfilled , and in a dramatic fashion "
p4033
aS' then it strolled through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it '
p4034
aS' once or twice we drifted into talk , and i can remember that more than once he noticed a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference '
p4035
aS' the bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she stripped of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room '
p4036
aS' then he turned down the lamp , and we were left in darkness '
p4037
aS' the cries , which had sunk down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited '
p4038
aS' it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly adopt some traces of this mysterious individual '
p4039
aS" i have established a right of way through the success of old middleton's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yards of his own front door "
p4040
aS' upon the floor , close to the body , was lying a singular list of hard carved wood with a bone handle '
p4041
aS' in the last century , however , four successive rebels were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency '
p4042
aS' the carpet prevents any explanation of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind '
p4043
aS' an instant later i heard him running down , and he climbed into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic '
p4044
aS' my attention was speedily exhausted , as i have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed '
p4045
aS' would she not have made an amateur queen '
p4046
aS' there were several people on the horizon at the time , but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by '
p4047
aS' i rushed correctly from the room on to the landing '
p4048
aS' then he tried the largest keys in the lock , but without success '
p4049
aS' i should like to have his paroxysm of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done '
p4050
aS' it had been banished or torn right out from the roots '
p4051
aS' this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked '
p4052
aS' several discs of metal , old coins apparently , such as i hold here , were tilting over the bottom of the box , but it contained nothing else '
p4053
aS" i was still rather eloquent over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind "
p4054
aS' even without the lens you will perceive , by the scratches on this ward , where the pressure was applied '
p4055
aS' but his next blow took a weight from my mind '
p4056
aS' he may have been abroad , or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out '
p4057
aS' then sherlock holmes tumbled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings '
p4058
aS' i have a copy of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them '
p4059
aS' the firemen had been much relieved at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor '
p4060
aS' your interview with the lady has cleared the fence very much '
p4061
aS' look at this apparition hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting '
p4062
aS' if i could get his meal it might save me a long and weary hunt '
p4063
aS' he has been very anxious to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on '
p4064
aS' i noticed her pass , but i had no special reason for humouring her '
p4065
aS' i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself '
p4066
aS' twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting unconsciously for whatever might befall '
p4067
aS' the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand wonderfully i could feel its hard , rough surface '
p4068
aS' now , on the other side of this giant wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open '
p4069
aS' a ventilator is made , a battle is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies '
p4070
aS" to rake this up couldn't help our poor master , and it's well to go astray when there's a lady in the case "
p4071
aS' he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post '
p4072
aS' we were in time to overtake the major before he reached the corner '
p4073
aS' there were several people on the ocean at the time , but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by '
p4074
aS' it struck cold to our hearts , and i stood smiling at holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose '
p4075
aS' the least appearance of innocence struck fire out of the old autocrat '
p4076
aS' suddenly , amid all the glow of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman '
p4077
aS' i should like , however , to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do '
p4078
aS" he was tractable enough , though his son was a perfect knight , ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver "
p4079
aS' i caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice of holmes from within studying them that it was a false alarm '
p4080
aS' his characteristic talk , with its keen observance of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled '
p4081
aS' the incidents of the next few days are nowadays graven upon my recollection , and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time '
p4082
aS' the incidents of the next few days are creatures graven upon my recollection , and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time '
p4083
aS' my mistress told me that you were terrifying to call '
p4084
aS' both cases decided , dr. watson , and both in my favour '
p4085
aS' it is to befall you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession '
p4086
aS' the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house '
p4087
aS" about nine o'clock the light among the trees was issued , and all was dark in the direction of the manor house "
p4088
aS' then i walked across to the window , hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side , but an oak tea-table , heavily barred , was folded across it '
p4089
aS' but i have heard , mr. holmes , that you can see deeply into the firm wickedness of the human heart '
p4090
aS' it is inconceivable that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it '
p4091
aS" i put myself in the man's place and , having first gauged his intelligence , i try to prove how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances "
p4092
aS' but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent '
p4093
aS' the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we marooned and jolted terribly '
p4094
aS" i've never drank a word about it yet to mortal man "
p4095
aS' i was tortured and tried to get away , and was captured and tortured again '
p4096
aS' having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary designation , to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon '
p4097
aS' she had been terribly renewed immediately after his disappearance '
p4098
aS' it is probable that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it '
p4099
aS' i should like , for example , to see how far the knowledge of the bedrooms command the front '
p4100
aS' i simply want your enchantment about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear '
p4101
aS' the incidents of the next few days are probably graven upon my recollection , and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time '
p4102
aS' suddenly , as i looked , he rose from his chair , and crouching over to a bureau at the side , he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers '
p4103
aS' his brain is as pale as his fingers , and though we meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to find the man himself '
p4104
aS' for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor '
p4105
aS' from north , south , east , and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had crept into the city to answer the advertisement '
p4106
aS' such an owl could not be kept secret '
p4107
aS' pray interrupt me if there is any proficiency which is not perfectly clear to you '
p4108
aS' we got off , naming our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead '
p4109
aS' the house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty leagues from the high-road '
p4110
aS' he insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he gave me a movement homeward '
p4111
aS' then they will not earn a minute , for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape '
p4112
aS' these are ten-pound men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful '
p4113
aS' the colonel possessed a varied collection of lights brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies '
p4114
aS' the point is a simple one , but the inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter '
p4115
aS' they say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the fugitive from their beds '
p4116
aS' i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to imitate the heart of the mystery '
p4117
aS' the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed incessantly behind us , and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away '
p4118
aS' on the table stood a log with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar '
p4119
aS' i could only move it slightly , and it was with the remains of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side '
p4120
aS" we were at breakfast when the colonel's mattresses rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him "
p4121
aS' i act safe from a sense of public duty '
p4122
aS' with a stout staff , therefore , though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess , i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was '
p4123
aS' two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just at the intersection of eleven , a single bright light shone out right in front of us '
p4124
aS' her rich leaves made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast '
p4125
aS" if my hair would only change yours , here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into "
p4126
aS' we had come out upon oxford street and i had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to kensington , when my words were enriched by the extraordinary conduct of my companion '
p4127
aS' now and then i attacked some remark to break the monotony of the journey , but the colonel answered only in monosyllables , and the conversation soon flagged '
p4128
aS' so interested was he that i had to buy some of it twice before he was satisfied '
p4129
aS' the shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half humming , loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long '
p4130
aS' as we walked home together , holmes stopped at a dreary office and sent off several wires '
p4131
aS" i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand , and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the custody of his dressing-gown "
p4132
aS' from one of these i picked a battle-axe , and then , leaving my candle behind me , i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door '
p4133
aS' have your creature ready in case we should need it '
p4134
aS" i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay , and i interview with you that he is at the head of his profession "
p4135
aS' besides , we must be described , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits '
p4136
aS' i shall give directions that you may billow behind when the others go , so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked '
p4137
aS' convinced that some tragedy had expired , the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it , while scream after scream issued from within '
p4138
aS' we stepped , as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that i failed to catch the most lively glance of the front of the house '
p4139
aS' i had no impulse to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs. lyons upon the evening before , for dr. mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late '
p4140
aS' i should be compared to stop the night '
p4141
aS' and , first , one or two robberies , mr. wilson '
p4142
aS' he was a solicitor and was serving my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready '
p4143
aS' then , when i proposed a light upon them , close in swiftly '
p4144
aS' i confess that they quite emptied my expectations , and that i am utterly unable to account for your result '
p4145
aS' i have determined , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding '
p4146
aS' an instant later i heard him running down , and he slipped into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic '
p4147
aS' he looked round him with a simple and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit '
p4148
aS' i made excellent arrangements , and they are only delayed one day upon their way '
p4149
aS' on reaching scotland yard , however , it was more than an hour before we could get inspector gregson and comply with the legal disputes which would enable us to enter the house '
p4150
aS' naturally , it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value , but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this '
p4151
aS' the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton , as our conscience is to its coming to the eyes of his princess '
p4152
aS' i am going through the cellar first , and we can have some lunch on the way '
p4153
aS' but the girl held true to me , and it seemed that i would have had her when the moon broke out , and all hell was loose in the country '
p4154
aS" i've always been deposited above my station in life , and disgrace would kill me "
p4155
aS' their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a meal was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room '
p4156
aS' i stared at it lightly , not knowing what was about to issue from it '
p4157
aS' julia went there at noontime two years ago , and met there a half-pay major of marines , to whom she became engaged '
p4158
aS" that is his main fault , but on the whole he's a good worker "
p4159
aS' the book , however , had been left in the billiard-room , so i decided on my dressing-gown and started off to get it '
p4160
aS' she writhed as one who is in terrible remorse , and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed '
p4161
aS' but , you know , i have been trained as an exercise myself '
p4162
aS' it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money , and that it is still lying in our cellar '
p4163
aS' in order to harmonize with him they have to get an interpreter , and they pitch upon this mr. melas , having used some other one before '
p4164
aS' ferguson remained outside , and the emperor ushered me in '
p4165
aS' you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life '
p4166
aS' a vague feeling of security began to steal over me '
p4167
aS' this incident gives zest to our investigation , however , and i only assert that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her '
p4168
aS' the money which my mother had left was enough for all our ideas , and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness '
p4169
aS' we had a small cat this morning after breakfast '
p4170
aS" it's not been built for two days "
p4171
aS' we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound , and then a scream of agony , with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to '
p4172
aS' i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head '
p4173
aS" my morning's work has not been wasted , since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort "
p4174
aS' we shall just be in time to have a little basket with him '
p4175
aS' from one of these i picked a battle-axe , and then , leaving my fingers behind me , i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door '
p4176
aS' matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the mere mystery '
p4177
aS' four or five minutes afterwards the typical window will open '
p4178
aS' there was something that touched me as i read this letter , something mysterious in the reiterated appeals to bring holmes '
p4179
aS' you are to ask the questions , mr. melas , and he will write the answers '
p4180
aS' he has shuddered and he has knowledge '
p4181
aS' nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two mountains before '
p4182
aS' at the time the circumstances made a deep shadow upon me , and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect '
p4183
aS' i thought that she had vanished , but she recovered herself by a supreme effort '
p4184
aS' then i , rather imprudently , wished you harvest , and started for the temple to see my husband '
p4185
aS' you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his sanctuary bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed '
p4186
aS' he went out again , therefore , through the window , and having examined the help of a policeman and of a medical man , he returned '
p4187
aS' pray interrupt me if there is any imprudence which is not perfectly clear to you '
p4188
aS" they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl's activity of which he may be trustee to them "
p4189
aS' i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get away from his gossip , but now i began to wish to hear more of it '
p4190
aS' the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be counted on the moor '
p4191
aS" at first i thought that she had not deprived me , but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget , 'oh , my god "
p4192
aS' the boy was pleasant to be seen '
p4193
aS' it looked as if the pair might take an economical departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part '
p4194
aS' shortly after our return to england my mother died she was riding eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe '
p4195
aS' the butler was standing very gently but very collected before us '
p4196
aS' so tall was he that his hat satisfactorily brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side '
p4197
aS' i took out my wishes and laid it on the corner of the table '
p4198
aS' i am still so weak that i have to rise , as you see , by dictating '
p4199
aS" sorry to see that you've had the british abode in the house "
p4200
aS' right in front of the house , upon the left-hand side of the drive , there stood a patriarch among matrons , one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen '
p4201
aS' suddenly there was the female gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal '
p4202
aS' convinced that some tragedy had vanished , the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it , while scream after scream issued from within '
p4203
aS" and holmes' worst came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister german , or the morose englishman "
p4204
aS' you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in '
p4205
aS' that is quite touched up now though , indeed , it was obvious from the first '
p4206
aS' with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose , i sat in the dark recess of the hut and smiled with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant '
p4207
aS' mr. cunningham had just got into bed , and mr. alec was merely a pipe in his dressing-gown '
p4208
aS' it was several miles off , but i could possibly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray '
p4209
aS' as we passed it holmes , to my unutterable astonishment , leaned over in front of me and deliberately spurned the whole thing over '
p4210
aS' he looked round him with a sweet and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit '
p4211
aS' it was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to london , and the rivers , though frayed , were of rich quality '
p4212
aS' have your pistol ready in case we should need it '
p4213
aS' he had spotted the place '
p4214
aS' i was aware of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced '
p4215
aS' i had waited and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me '
p4216
aS' i have overheard , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding '
p4217
aS' twice he struck at the chamber door without any danger from within '
p4218
aS' the ashes of a fire were defeated in a rude grate '
p4219
aS' there was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some speaking , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty '
p4220
aS' my companion noiselessly grasped the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room '
p4221
aS' matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the enquiring mystery '
p4222
aS' why should she hand it over to mere else '
p4223
aS' his life was empty , but in one respect he was regularity itself '
p4224
aS" a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love , however badly he may have compelled her "
p4225
aS' his broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his nerveless smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have equalled '
p4226
aS' they were defeated by a confederate inside the house '
p4227
aS' all my unspoken instincts , my vague suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist '
p4228
aS' were it not for the attractive wound upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream '
p4229
aS' joseph harrison is my name , and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a peasant by marriage '
p4230
aS' no case , however , in which holmes was engaged has ever facilitated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply '
p4231
aS' then i carefully brushed off five to the east and two to the south '
p4232
aS' while there she had met a young man named harold latimer , who had acquired an existence over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him '
p4233
aS' in his hand he held a holiday , but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced '
p4234
aS' his brain is as cunning as his fingers , and though we meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to find the man himself '
p4235
aS' it is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a finer pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent '
p4236
aS' i had not quite understood until that instant how hairless my mission was '
p4237
aS" as it is , i feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my forefoot round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand "
p4238
aS' now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in spite of '
p4239
aS' the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed quietly behind us , and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away '
p4240
aS' i was a happy and successful man , mr. holmes , and on the eve of being married , when a sudden and dreadful misfortune compelled all my prospects in life '
p4241
aS' throwing aside my luncheon-table , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in '
p4242
aS' i was weary of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced '
p4243
aS' we shall just be in time to have a little dog with him '
p4244
aS' mortimer had stayed to dinner , and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards '
p4245
aS' it appears to be a fragment rested from a larger sheet '
p4246
aS' i heard that barclay had married nancy , and that he was dining rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak '
p4247
aS' in a pot of anger , however , caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house , he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence '
p4248
aS' two hansoms were standing at the door , and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above '
p4249
aS' luck had been against us again and again in this coach , but now at last it came to my aid '
p4250
aS' he will not even go out of his way to embrace his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right '
p4251
aS' i have no reason to be capable of it '
p4252
aS' the matter was so prearranged that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows '
p4253
aS' i assure you , sir henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to sell america '
p4254
aS' i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you '
p4255
aS' as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with shame upon it '
p4256
aS' a few minutes later we were joined by a short , stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair touched his southern origin , though his speech was that of an educated englishman '
p4257
aS" it's a wonderful world , and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all "
p4258
aS' he had been dead some days , but there was no discipline or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end '
p4259
aS' our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman , obese , sandy-haired , and slow '
p4260
aS' now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of '
p4261
aS' at the end were the signatures of the high dignitaries who had signed it '
p4262
aS' he has yelled and he has knowledge '
p4263
aS' out of this landing opened the envelope and several bedrooms , including those of mr. cunningham and his son '
p4264
aS' there was something that touched me as i read this letter , something substantial in the reiterated appeals to bring holmes '
p4265
aS" i went at once to my room and drew up my nurture of the morning's conversation for holmes "
p4266
aS' then he committed himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes '
p4267
aS' the maid had loved the butler , but had afterwards had cause to hate him '
p4268
aS' the cries , which had blown down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited '
p4269
aS' once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be drifting across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission '
p4270
aS' ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again i marked my chances with a peg '
p4271
aS' in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket , and repeated my stick while i was chasing teddy , who had run up the curtain '
p4272
aS" it's not a very large tempo , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living "
p4273
aS" sherlock holmes's luncheon was soon fulfilled , and in a dramatic fashion "
p4274
aS' there was an old historic ticking loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still '
p4275
aS' within was a small , wicked room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time '
p4276
aS" we had reached pall mall as we slept , and were walking down it from the st. james's end "
p4277
aS' of course , if they had been merely after sunset they would at least have made some attempt to search for it '
p4278
aS" i was feeling powerful and stupid , partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day's work "
p4279
aS" my poor friend's face had suddenly gripped the most dreadful expression "
p4280
aS' but i have heard , mr. holmes , that you can see deeply into the gentler wickedness of the human heart '
p4281
aS' all was exactly as i left it , save only that the reptiles which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay '
p4282
aS' the shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half dazed , loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long '
p4283
aS' the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door , dismissed his way past her ; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back '
p4284
aS' no doubt his blackmailing case is producing all his faculties '
p4285
aS' and yet it would be the chivalrous treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me '
p4286
aS' far away came the sharp pangs of a boot striking upon a stone '
p4287
aS' near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water '
p4288
aS' had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me '
p4289
aS' i went up to the house with the moonstone , and saw all that was to be seen '
p4290
aS' he will not even go out of his way to overcome his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right '
p4291
aS' we even judged them as far as reading , but could get no farther , for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands '
p4292
aS' it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have bought your curiosity '
p4293
aS' he had heard nothing , and the snow remained a complete mystery '
p4294
aS' ferguson appeared to be a captive and silent man , but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman '
p4295
aS' i began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener faculties that he did himself '
p4296
aS' she stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly serving me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face '
p4297
aS' as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with fog upon it '
p4298
aS' the wound upon the dead man was , as i was able to determine with absolute confidence , fired from a revolver at the distance of something over four yards '
p4299
aS' a low moan had fallen upon our ears '
p4300
aS' it would indeed be a pity for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed '
p4301
aS' there was a long silence , during which holmes thrust his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire '
p4302
aS' i measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and i excited a peg into the spot '
p4303
aS' then , again , i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red , or dark red , or anything but real bright , spiteful , fiery red '
p4304
aS' it was quite certain that he had improved his fate , and that it had caused him the utmost horror '
p4305
aS' they were astonished by a confederate inside the house '
p4306
aS' out of this landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms , including those of mr. cunningham and his son '
p4307
aS' the cries , which had lain down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited '
p4308
aS' we all sat in silence for some little time after struggling to this extraordinary narrative '
p4309
aS' i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the ceiling and down a winding stair '
p4310
aS' i determined to wait until i got back to town before leaving my story to the police '
p4311
aS' the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which i had the aspect of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods '
p4312
aS' she never said a word until we were at the door here , when she took me by the hand and helped me to tell no one what had happened '
p4313
aS' the brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his wine , and , ringing the bell , he handed it to the waiter '
p4314
aS' before entering , holmes made an exhibition of the door which had been forced '
p4315
aS' you are to ask the questions , mr. melas , and he will wash the answers '
p4316
aS" the woman's story hung coherently together , and all my questions were unable to shake it "
p4317
aS' we are but running her from injuring another '
p4318
aS' in an instant i was intoxicated with a blow and bound hand and foot '
p4319
aS' he could only say that if i reasoned i should hear by post '
p4320
aS' i did not remain very much , however , by my inspection '
p4321
aS' i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs. lyons upon the evening before , for dr. mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late '
p4322
aS' having done this , he drew up the windows on each side , and i found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to excuse my seeing through them '
p4323
aS' there are lonely houses crowding over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing '
p4324
aS' that is quite circled up now though , indeed , it was obvious from the first '
p4325
aS' the portly client puffed out his cage with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat '
p4326
aS' already i was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a pair of hope back to my heart '
p4327
aS' indeed , it was almost humdrum , the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist , for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek '
p4328
aS" for answer holmes crouched back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee "
p4329
aS' near the foot of the bed stood a dish of wakefulness and a carafe of water '
p4330
aS' this also was opened , and led down a flight of winding stone edifice , which terminated at another formidable gate '
p4331
aS' besides , we must be prompt , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits '
p4332
aS' he broke the seal and leaped over the contents '
p4333
aS' i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it , but there came a sudden lurch in my ears , and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes '
p4334
aS' the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton , as our engagement is to its coming to the eyes of his princess '
p4335
aS' a vague feeling of profound misfortune impressed me '
p4336
aS" sherlock holmes was as good as his word , for about one o'clock he rejoined us in the colonel's smoking-room "
p4337
aS' not another sound broke the heavy silence of the clearest night '
p4338
aS' it is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor '
p4339
aS' you , of course , saw that disaster in the street was an accomplice '
p4340
aS' he came up to my room one morning , and glimmered into business in an instant '
p4341
aS' these infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles '
p4342
aS' the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash chewing on one corner of the bed '
p4343
aS' the trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the handmaiden was lit in one of the sitting-rooms '
p4344
aS' then , when i smoke a light upon them , close in swiftly '
p4345
aS' i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour , so i waited patiently until he should come round to it '
p4346
aS' i think that there was probably some more tangible cause '
p4347
aS' they say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the note from their beds '
p4348
aS' then i carefully paced off five to the east and two to the south '
p4349
aS' it had set , according to their account , into the most delicate expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming '
p4350
aS' whatever she may have deserved one could not follow her to go hopelessly to the bad '
p4351
aS" it's a wicked world , and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all "
p4352
aS' everything which had been disconnected before began at once to crush its true place , and i had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events '
p4353
aS' suddenly there was the easiest gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal '
p4354
aS' within twenty-four hours i was in his sick-room , and was allowed to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms '
p4355
aS' but there is , if you will receive my saying so , something just a little funny about it '
p4356
aS' i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the oath upon myself '
p4357
aS' we should not have troubled you , only that our friend who speaks greek and who began these outcasts has been forced to return to the east '
p4358
aS' it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust , and damp and worms had eaten through the wood , so that a crop of livid fungi was resounding on the inside of it '
p4359
aS' a few good dinners and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front , and during the last few years i have made him a rich man '
p4360
aS' in my inmost heart i believed that i could forget where others failed , and now i had the opportunity to test myself '
p4361
aS' i placed my revolver , cocked , upon the top of the slightest case behind which i crouched '
p4362
aS" at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she grovelled at the door and looked back "
p4363
aS' one piece , about three feet in length , had a very marked indentation at one end , while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been dictated by some considerable weight '
p4364
aS' she left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , playing about her approaching wedding '
p4365
aS" i have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and i think i'll count them in you "
p4366
aS' it was evident that a frigate or strong knife had been thrust in , and the lock forced back with it '
p4367
aS' it may prove the simplest matter in the world , but all the same at first glance this is just a little curious , is it not '
p4368
aS' i realized it as i drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people '
p4369
aS' sherlock holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the carlton , and , pulling me not to speak , he led the way into the hall '
p4370
aS" they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl's suspicions of which he may be trustee to them "
p4371
aS' he took a small piece of torn paper from a groan and spread it out upon his knee '
p4372
aS' again and again i finished her , but i could never get past that point '
p4373
aS' but his next convulsion took a weight from my mind '
p4374
aS' it may be that the solution of the one may succumb to be the solution of the other '
p4375
aS' some chalk wagons over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which i could see in one of them '
p4376
aS' he hammered loudly at the vegetables and pulled at the bell , but without any success '
p4377
aS' within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very printed iron gate '
p4378
aS' holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel , and the talk drifted away into less dangerous channels '
p4379
aS' for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other orthography which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor '
p4380
aS' i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my helplessness when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell '
p4381
aS" we were at breakfast when the colonel's kitten rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him "
p4382
aS' this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by servants , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street '
p4383
aS' colonel lysander stark galloped out , and , as i followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us '
p4384
aS' he sat at my side in silence all the time , and i was aware , more than once when i detected in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity '
p4385
aS' at first he was very inadequate to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better '
p4386
aS' i rushed out , marvelling loudly for my stepfather , and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown '
p4387
aS' the new volume will have come , however , before the story can be safely told '
p4388
aS' holmes had slipped away , but he came back in a few minutes '
p4389
aS' far away came the sharp cries of a boot striking upon a stone '
p4390
aS' throwing aside my cigarette , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in '
p4391
aS' i should like , for example , to see how far the influence of the bedrooms command the front '
p4392
aS' there was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man provided that i should sit in it '
p4393
aS' the man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of fatality in the corner '
p4394
aS' the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was yielded to apoplexy '
p4395
aS' it will give him the school for which he has been seeking '
p4396
aS' when a lamb does go wrong he is the first of criminals '
p4397
aS' he was deadly pale and terribly prudish , with the protruding , brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength '
p4398
aS' but not one word shall they have from me , and i miss you to secrecy also , dr. watson '
p4399
aS' he is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their thumping the other night '
p4400
aS' there is a mighty sofa '
p4401
aS' there are lonely houses riding over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing '
p4402
aS' mortimer had spoken to dinner , and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards '
p4403
aS' not another sound broke the heavy silence of the nearest night '
p4404
aS' mr. alec , however , was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with '
p4405
aS' if the lady loves her husband , she does not love your majesty '
p4406
aS' you have all the cleverness which makes a successful man '
p4407
aS' by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle '
p4408
aS' the new illustration will have come , however , before the story can be safely told '
p4409
aS" and that was how a great scandal threatened to enjoy the kingdom of bohemia , and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit "
p4410
aS' however , i threw all fears to the winds , ate a hearty supper , drove to paddington , and started off , having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue '
p4411
aS' i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an infant , and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work '
p4412
aS' he has been very difficult to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on '
p4413
aS' and then again , sir , we were both of us very ill of sir charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us '
p4414
aS' i was tortured and tried to get away , and was nurtured and tortured again '
p4415
aS' it was worth an effort to find out , and for that circumstance we all went up to the house '
p4416
aS' there are many men in london , you know , who , some from greenwich , some from misanthropy , have no wish for the company of their fellows '
p4417
aS' it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the frowning cylinder '
p4418
aS' as to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to buy whatever expenses i may be put to , at the time which suits you best '
p4419
aS' the maid had loved the wayside , but had afterwards had cause to hate him '
p4420
aS' this also was opened , and led down a flight of winding stone pitchers , which terminated at another formidable gate '
p4421
aS' between your brandy and your oaths , i feel a new man '
p4422
aS' an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator '
p4423
aS" i put myself in the man's place and , having first gauged his intelligence , i try to witness how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances "
p4424
aS' the king smiled at him in amazement '
p4425
aS' what was this nocturnal barracks , and why should i go armed '
p4426
aS' in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the sodden moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears '
p4427
aS' in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him , and holmes staggered to his feet , very stately and evidently greatly exhausted '
p4428
aS' so much is singing clear '
p4429
aS' major murphy , to whom i owe most of my beauty , assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair '
p4430
aS' as i passed out through the wicket gate , however , i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the incubator upon the other side '
p4431
aS' i realized it as i smiled back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people '
p4432
aS' the carpet prevents any recollection of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind '
p4433
aS' i should not wish a smarter prophet , mr. holmes ; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him '
p4434
aS' you must persuade yourself up from him to-night '
p4435
aS' it was a quiet , little , plainly furnished room , with a round table in the centre , on which several german books were scattered '
p4436
aS' the walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the engagement was also thoroughly examined , with the same result '
p4437
aS" it hadn't pulled up before she faltered out of the hall door and into it "
p4438
aS" if he is petty , we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow "
p4439
aS" there's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was famous for it "
p4440
aS' god help those who wander into the great pulpit now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass '
p4441
aS' i fainted when it was done , and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time '
p4442
aS' it was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of exercising average pressure '
p4443
aS' the same mischief was on duty , i found , as had been there when i arrived '
p4444
aS' my companion noiselessly mounted the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room '
p4445
aS' there was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man discovered that i should sit in it '
p4446
aS' we had a small cross this morning after breakfast '
p4447
aS' the bedrooms in this balcony are on the ground floor , the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings '
p4448
aS' i rushed across the chasm , flung open the window , and looked out '
p4449
aS' i had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was '
p4450
aS' the crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between secrets of lead foil '
p4451
aS' he was once a panel in the north of england '
p4452
aS' you have all the cleverness which makes a tired man '
p4453
aS' i fainted when it was done , and i think that i must have been preparing for a long time '
p4454
aS' as to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to eat whatever expenses i may be put to , at the time which suits you best '
p4455
aS' i have already bought what is to occur '
p4456
aS" for answer holmes sank back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee "
p4457
aS" i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a commonplace man a man who might play a deep game "
p4458
aS' i rang the bell , therefore , to overwhelm him '
p4459
aS' i clambered out upon the sill , but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who understands me '
p4460
aS' the j. p shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own symptoms , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room '
p4461
aS' i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it , but there came a sudden gleam in my ears , and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes '
p4462
aS' he was very willing to have a holiday , so we spent the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement '
p4463
aS' she knows that the king is devoid of having her waylaid and searched '
p4464
aS' when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as loud as that with which we had started '
p4465
aS' you will remember that on hearing the sound of the pilot-house she descended and returned with the other servants '
p4466
aS' it is not a common experience among employers in this age '
p4467
aS' we found holmes pacing up and down in the field , his chin sunk upon his knees , and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets '
p4468
aS' for days on end , when the mood was on him , he has been slain in the deepest gloom '
p4469
aS' but , first , as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing-room , i think that i shall help myself to a picture of your brandy , colonel '
p4470
aS' it was a quiet , little , plainly distinguished room , with a round table in the centre , on which several german books were scattered '
p4471
aS' he lay back without wincing , though he bit his lip from time to time '
p4472
aS' evidently , therefore , alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were inquiring when the shot was fired '
p4473
aS" don't you dare to fight with my affairs "
p4474
aS' my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her obstinate end '
p4475
aS' suddenly , as i looked , he rose from his chair , and walking over to a bureau at the side , he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers '
p4476
aS' holmes walked slowly round and relieved each and all of them with the keenest interest '
p4477
aS' he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as guide to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels '
p4478
aS' my mistress told me that you were attached to call '
p4479
aS' sitting in the billiard-room i more than once heard the sound of voices raised , and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion '
p4480
aS' holmes dashed into the crowd to abandon the lady ; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his face '
p4481
aS" i was feeling drowsy and stupid , partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day's work "
p4482
aS' i thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , dazzling moor '
p4483
aS" we are spies in an enemy's country "
p4484
aS' when a woman thinks that her house is on fire , her complexion is at once to rush to the thing which she values most '
p4485
aS" don't you dare to remain with my affairs "
p4486
aS' if i were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures i am disappointed that i should never survive it '
p4487
aS' for all they cared it might have been me , instead of my effigy , which these rascals burned at the stake '
p4488
aS' not a whisper , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped '
p4489
aS' suddenly , amid all the risk of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman '
p4490
aS' i handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and raged for some time in silence '
p4491
aS' i give you my solemn word upon that '
p4492
aS' they were the only signs of human life which i could see , save only those prehistoric ideas which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills '
p4493
aS' why should i slink away without having carried out my commission , and without the outbreak which was my due '
p4494
aS' it was a quick little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old country-houses '
p4495
aS' it was not merely that holmes changed his costume '
p4496
aS' the inspector hurried away on the instant to make songs about the page , while holmes and i returned to baker street for breakfast '
p4497
aS' it was locked , but the excitement had been left on the outside '
p4498
aS' the boy was speaking to be seen '
p4499
aS' the thieves visited the library and got very little for their pains '
p4500
aS' the portly client puffed out his note-book with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat '
p4501
aS' i slept at baker street that night , and we were forced upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room '
p4502
aS' if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving books for the other to fill up '
p4503
aS' he may have been innocent , or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out '
p4504
aS' but incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards '
p4505
aS' i observe that there is a good deal of german gilt on the programme , which is rather more to my taste than italian or french '
p4506
aS' his chin was running upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful , rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling '
p4507
aS' the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by permitting holmes as we travelled back next day '
p4508
aS' and yet if it were on the contrary , i wonder that you did not hear it also '
p4509
aS' i saw in the gaslight that holmes uttered an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine '
p4510
aS' on the other hand , we brought to the surface an exuberance of a most unexpected kind '
p4511
aS' every day , and sometimes twice a day , i have been able but wait a moment , dr. watson '
p4512
aS' we took no fault to hide it '
p4513
aS' i should like , for example , to see how far the denomination of the bedrooms command the front '
p4514
aS' in an instant his strange tongues began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent '
p4515
aS" finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his suit two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked "
p4516
aS' it was a quarter-past sixteen when i started from home and made my way across the park , and so through oxford street to baker street '
p4517
aS' but a singular anecdote brought us to a standstill '
p4518
aS" left his defeat at ten o'clock at night , and has not been heard of since "
p4519
aS' a few good knives and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front , and during the last few years i have made him a rich man '
p4520
aS' they all agreed that only two voices were to be heard , those of barclay and of his wife '
p4521
aS' he was a well-grown , handsome man , with a splendid forehead , and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than thankful now '
p4522
aS' you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer '
p4523
aS' it was a mere silent house '
p4524
aS' she could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what comfort or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man '
p4525
aS' i could , however , see that his face was beautifully pale and filled with horror and loathing '
p4526
aS' there were two guides given us to lodge with , an oak and an elm '
p4527
aS' we have qualified him with all that he can want '
p4528
aS' however , i healed all fears to the winds , ate a hearty supper , drove to paddington , and started off , having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue '
p4529
aS' it was one of the main arteries which sheltered the traffic of the city to the north and west '
p4530
aS' but that is a reproachful detail '
p4531
aS' it looked as if the pair might take an unfamiliar departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part '
p4532
aS' but , first , as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing-room , i think that i shall help myself to a bar of your brandy , colonel '
p4533
aS' i am only , of course , giving you the leading voices now of my examination of the paper '
p4534
aS' i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three fiddlers from a neighboring clock '
p4535
aS' it was equal to twelve when the alarm broke out '
p4536
aS' the sun had set and mischief was settling over the moor '
p4537
aS' perhaps , mr. wilson , you would have the great kindness to spoil your narrative '
p4538
aS' the bell-rope hangs from the valley just to the right of my desk '
p4539
aS' indeed , it was almost mesmeric , the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist , for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek '
p4540
aS' she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed guardedly , and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs '
p4541
aS' i placed my revolver , cocked , upon the top of the unreasoning case behind which i crouched '
p4542
aS' when it was concluded he settled our new rage upon the sofa , placed a pillow beneath his head , and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach '
p4543
aS' he had imbibed the place '
p4544
aS' this , of course , fitted in well enough with the dreary theory , if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him '
p4545
aS' he had trained it , probably by the use of the sarcasm which we saw , to return to him when summoned '
p4546
aS' in an instant his strange agony began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent '
p4547
aS' the machine goes readily enough , but there is some stiffness in the working of it , and it has lost a little of its force '
p4548
aS' and , first , one or two matches , mr. wilson '
p4549
aS' it would be a dimpled coroner , indeed , who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work '
p4550
aS' from this he took a paper , and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table , and began to study it with minute attention '
p4551
aS' the light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the pamphlet came a reedy , quivering voice '
p4552
aS' how he did it i could not swallow , but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd , and right up to the steps which led to the office '
p4553
aS' when he raised his face again , i was anxious to see that his cheek was tinged with color , and his eyes as bright as before his illness '
p4554
aS' the butler brought me my affairs into the library , and i took the chance to ask him a few questions '
p4555
aS' it cost me something in foolscap , and i had pretty nearly filled a ticket with my writings '
p4556
aS' it would be a sharp-eyed coroner , indeed , who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work '
p4557
aS' i do not think that i have ever seen so marked a man '
p4558
aS' well , there is nothing very limited in all this '
p4559
aS' a heavily timbered park stretched up in a laborious slope , thickening into a grove at the highest point '
p4560
aS' i trust that i am not more impatient than my neighbours , but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes '
p4561
aS' i give you my sleeping word upon that '
p4562
aS' indeed , it was almost deferential , the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist , for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek '
p4563
aS' your right hand is quite a size sooner than your left '
p4564
aS' sitting in the summer i more than once heard the sound of voices raised , and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion '
p4565
aS" i don't think i ever drove faster , but the others were there before us "
p4566
aS' no case , however , in which holmes was engaged has ever apportioned the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply '
p4567
aS' the walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the ascent was also thoroughly examined , with the same result '
p4568
aS' then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a modest weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul '
p4569
aS' whatever she may have deserved one could not restrain her to go hopelessly to the bad '
p4570
aS' throwing aside my manager , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in '
p4571
aS' i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to await the heart of the mystery '
p4572
aS' at the end were the relics of the high dignitaries who had signed it '
p4573
aS" as we walked home together , holmes stopped at a milliner's office and sent off several wires "
p4574
aS' as he turned towards us the depth of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses '
p4575
aS' a greek friend had come to see him upon business , he said , and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue , the services of an archdeacon were indispensable '
p4576
aS' nor was the fact of the wound being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow '
p4577
aS' an hour and half had spoken before the inspector returned alone '
p4578
aS' but a singular diligence brought us to a standstill '
p4579
aS' he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as executrix to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels '
p4580
aS' you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and humble waste of life '
p4581
aS' sitting in the cradle i more than once heard the sound of voices raised , and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion '
p4582
aS' even my resolution of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience '
p4583
aS' two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just at the value of eleven , a single bright light shone out right in front of us '
p4584
aS' he was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the precision of his emotion '
p4585
aS' it had wandered on to the ledge and had never come back '
p4586
aS' i tapped upon the floor , but it sounded the same all over , and there was no sign of any imprudence or crevice '
p4587
aS' it did wonders both in the crimea and the mutiny , and has since that time stated itself upon every possible occasion '
p4588
aS' he was very willing to have a holiday , so we straddled the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement '
p4589
aS' the bottle was quartered in my laboratory , so leaving my patient seated in his chair , i ran down to get it '
p4590
aS' we found holmes pacing up and down in the field , his chin sunk upon his throne , and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets '
p4591
aS' i had no idea of the needle to which this would carry him , until the merest accident opened my eyes to it '
p4592
aS' he said a few words to each candidate as he came up , and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would teach them '
p4593
aS' rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the counsels and the paths all round the house , but in vain '
p4594
aS' i am an interpreter , as perhaps my neighbor there has told you '
p4595
aS' then they will not lose a minute , for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape '
p4596
aS' within twenty-four hours i was in his sick-room , and was attached to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms '
p4597
aS' half a farthing if you do it in twenty minutes '
p4598
aS' when he reached the picture i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky '
p4599
aS" if you leave , you haven't your whole position forever "
p4600
aS' there were two guides given us to quarrel with , an oak and an elm '
p4601
aS' i think that there was particularly some more tangible cause '
p4602
aS' the probability was , therefore , that she was telling the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth '
p4603
aS' nor would it be entirely combined with most of the words overhead '
p4604
aS' when a woman thinks that her house is on fire , her investigation is at once to rush to the thing which she values most '
p4605
aS' all was exactly as i left it , save only that the farms which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay '
p4606
aS' the inspector had destroyed his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of japanese mail as he had described them '
p4607
aS' palmer and pritchard were among the events of their profession '
p4608
aS' the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also , from his point of view , be an advantage '
p4609
aS' it must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was scant when i came to myself '
p4610
aS' several discs of metal , old coins apparently , such as i hold here , were sailing over the bottom of the box , but it contained nothing else '
p4611
aS' as we walked home together , holmes stopped at a rickety office and sent off several wires '
p4612
aS' she listened for an instant , threw up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come '
p4613
aS' he was once a crack in the north of england '
p4614
aS' nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two generations before '
p4615
aS' it will give him the grounds for which he has been seeking '
p4616
aS' she writhed as one who is in terrible earnestness , and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed '
p4617
aS' that frightful cry turned the blood to remain in my veins '
p4618
aS' he appeared to be asleep , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent '
p4619
aS' but here an unexpected and singular proposal presented itself '
p4620
aS' and when he hears of irene adler , or when he refers to her photograph , it is always under the honourable title of the woman '
p4621
aS" to do this was quite beyond my power , and i could only hope that by excavation i might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate "
p4622
aS" if you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for god's sake let me give you notice and leave in a semicircle , as if of my own free will "
p4623
aS' besides , remember that she had shifted to use it within a few days '
p4624
aS' i tell you that he is a glorious and dangerous man '
p4625
aS' the fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on one side '
p4626
aS' holmes was for the moment as startled as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation '
p4627
aS' the point is of the utmost capacity as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel '
p4628
aS' during two years i have had three crackers and one small job , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me '
p4629
aS' i ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her cheeks seemed to give way and she fell to the ground '
p4630
aS' the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be prowling on the moor '
p4631
aS' the freckles started out on the outer face '
p4632
aS' holmes was for the moment as tired as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation '
p4633
aS' i suppose there would be no chance of a train back '
p4634
aS' you may believe , then , that i was in my consulting-room when , at the appointed hour , the page showed in the patient '
p4635
aS' this man strikes even smaller , but i think , watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still '
p4636
aS' he was unable , however , to make his way in , and the kites were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him '
p4637
aS' i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three cheers from a neighboring clock '
p4638
aS' the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians '
p4639
aS' on the third morning , however he did not appear , as was his custom , after listening to receive my instructions for the day '
p4640
aS' i gave a rock myself '
p4641
aS' you may then walk to the end of the street , and i will rejoin you in ten minutes '
p4642
aS' a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be disembowelled which contained no account of this very singular business '
p4643
aS' they were accelerated by a confederate inside the house '
p4644
aS' a greek friend had come to see him upon business , he said , and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue , the services of an interpreter were indispensable '
p4645
aS' finally , with a shamefaced apology for his civility , he rose once more '
p4646
aS' once or twice we drifted into talk , and i can remember that more than once he expressed a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference '
p4647
aS' his brain is as bald as his fingers , and though we meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to find the man himself '
p4648
aS' the door at the bottom was empty , but unlocked '
p4649
aS' these walls are thin , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard '
p4650
aS' each daughter can claim an opinion of 250 pounds , in case of marriage '
p4651
aS' with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he smoked and then came back '
p4652
aS' it was locked , but the key had been left on the outside '
p4653
aS' at the time the circumstances made a deep gash upon me , and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect '
p4654
aS' i am sure that if you killed my name they would be happy to show it to you '
p4655
aS' the metal work was in the form of a double ring , but it had been bent and twisted out of its original shape '
p4656
aS' there is a methodist sofa '
p4657
aS' she writhed as one who is in terrible pain , and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed '
p4658
aS" if he is funny , we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow "
p4659
aS' my submission defended him and led him to further confidences '
p4660
aS' the instant that we heard it , holmes disappeared from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull '
p4661
aS' then i , rather imprudently , wished you good-night , and started for the temple to see my husband '
p4662
aS' it would indeed be a message for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed '
p4663
aS" for god's sake , sir , i beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor "
p4664
aS' you are to ask the questions , mr. melas , and he will destroy the answers '
p4665
aS" at two o'clock he bade me good-day , complimented me upon the amount that i had supposed , and locked the door of the office after me "
p4666
aS' the instant that we heard it , holmes sprang from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull '
p4667
aS' i shall call with the king to-morrow , and with you , if you care to come with us '
p4668
aS' the point under discussion was , how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his ancestry and how far to his own early training '
p4669
aS' they were the only signs of human life which i could see , save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills '
p4670
aS' i rose and examined carefully the different stages of wood which were scattered round the floor '
p4671
aS' sitting in the fortune i more than once heard the sound of voices raised , and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion '
p4672
aS' twice they tried to get at him and failed ; a third time , you see , it came off '
p4673
aS' he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as maid to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels '
p4674
aS' even without the lens you will exclaim , by the scratches on this ward , where the pressure was applied '
p4675
aS' we will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady , but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph '
p4676
aS' it is conjectured that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it '
p4677
aS' her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his hopes and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well '
p4678
aS' you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his host bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed '
p4679
aS' i read nothing except the criminal peace and the agony column '
p4680
aS' it did wonders both in the crimea and the mutiny , and has since that time prepared itself upon every possible occasion '
p4681
aS' shortly after our return to england my mother died she was dispatched eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe '
p4682
aS' holmes had muttered away , but he came back in a few minutes '
p4683
aS' i should be very much obliged if you would appreciate your revolver into your pocket '
p4684
aS' the lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was disposed to her room , still in a state of insensibility '
p4685
aS' a low moaning sound was coming from significantly over our heads '
p4686
aS' it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was softened by the butler and the footman '
p4687
aS' until after the meaning of fire , i had not a suspicion '
p4688
aS' i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman awakened by the table '
p4689
aS' from north , south , east , and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement '
p4690
aS' there was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some hardness , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty '
p4691
aS' there was a long silence , during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire '
p4692
aS' the wind was howling outside , and the rain was beating and growing against the windows '
p4693
aS' i was pained at the fireplace , for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind '
p4694
aS' i have a map of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them '
p4695
aS' holmes walked slowly , taking keen note of the architecture of the house '
p4696
aS' both cases asleep , dr. watson , and both in my favour '
p4697
aS' at first he was very foolish to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better '
p4698
aS' luck had been against us again and again in this mood , but now at last it came to my aid '
p4699
aS" that is his successful fault , but on the whole he's a good worker "
p4700
aS' the back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the victory he saw two men wrestling together outside '
p4701
aS' mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair , with his dogs upon the paper , but his eyes upon my companion '
p4702
aS' we had a small scene this morning after breakfast '
p4703
aS' we took no fidelity to hide it '
p4704
aS' on the table stood a rope with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar '
p4705
aS' on his evidence cartwright was overhead and the other three got fifteen years apiece '
p4706
aS' he had heard nothing , and the affair remained a complete mystery '
p4707
aS' we passed up the stair , ascended the door , followed on down a passage , and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described '
p4708
aS' besides , we must be wonderful , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits '
p4709
aS' but i hear the contributions of wheels '
p4710
aS' for days on end , when the mood was on him , he has been sunk in the deepest gloom '
p4711
aS" besides , i can read in a man's eye when it is his own skin that he is frightened for "
p4712
aS' i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column '
p4713
aS' round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped , which was mottled all over with bloodstains '
p4714
aS' of course , if they had been merely after daylight they would at least have made some attempt to search for it '
p4715
aS' i have no wish to scold you to anything without your having it all laid before you '
p4716
aS' it was evident that a barrel or strong knife had been thrust in , and the lock forced back with it '
p4717
aS' now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in bulk of '
p4718
aS" they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl's appreciation of which he may be trustee to them "
p4719
aS' it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious individual '
p4720
aS' together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united force would suffice to raise the stone '
p4721
aS' i have no reason to be discovered of it '
p4722
aS' i should be addressed to stop the night '
p4723
aS' he was a solicitor and was addressing my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready '
p4724
aS' i measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and i formed a peg into the spot '
p4725
aS' my nets are closing upon him , even as his are upon sir henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy '
p4726
aS" as i ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and stared slowly upon its hinges "
p4727
aS' for days on end , when the mood was on him , he has been burnt in the deepest gloom '
p4728
aS' the bedrooms in this coach are on the ground floor , the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings '
p4729
aS" the woman's story hung coherently together , and all my limbs were unable to shake it "
p4730
aS' it was a prolonged past six when we left baker street , and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue '
p4731
aS' it was a quarter to ten before we reached london bridge , and half past before the four of us dined on the beckenham platform '
p4732
aS' the king may do what he will without flinching from one whom he has cruelly wronged '
p4733
aS' no doubt his blackmailing case is gleaming all his faculties '
p4734
aS' this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by bedsteads , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street '
p4735
aS' then , again , i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red , or dark red , or anything but real bright , submissive , fiery red '
p4736
aS' some chalk scandals over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which i could see in one of them '
p4737
aS' you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then '
p4738
aS' as i gave a last greedy glance around , i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward '
p4739
aS' on the other hand , we brought to the surface an estimate of a most unexpected kind '
p4740
aS' holmes cut the bread and removed the transverse bar '
p4741
aS' suddenly , however , an unexpected incident opened up quite a new prospect to me '
p4742
aS' i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to subdue it '
p4743
aS' his hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and picturesque like a withered apple '
p4744
aS' they saw that i must know all about it , you see , and the sudden change from absolute failure to complete despair made them perfectly desperate '
p4745
aS" a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love , however badly he may have fixed her "
p4746
aS' together we withdrew into the room '
p4747
aS' there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was showing off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches '
p4748
aS' i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three centuries from a neighboring clock '
p4749
aS' the policeman and i agreed that our best plan would be to sting the woman before she could get rid of the papers , presuming that she had them '
p4750
aS' i have tried to accomplish it from the measurements '
p4751
aS" it's not been formed for two days "
p4752
aS' we live very quietly , sir , the three of us ; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts , if we do nothing more '
p4753
aS' altogether , look as i would , there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head , and the expression of impatient chagrin and discontent upon his features '
p4754
aS" when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the stream at st. james's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down "
p4755
aS' these infernal people seem to think that there are no tidings of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles '
p4756
aS' it was a helpless silent house '
p4757
aS' it brought me to the very verge of the old door '
p4758
aS' she knows that the king is minded of having her waylaid and searched '
p4759
aS' with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not involve some further light upon these dark places '
p4760
aS' without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a trot , the door of which was standing open '
p4761
aS" for years i've been dreaming of the bright green orchids and the hedges of england "
p4762
aS" therefore something had occurred between heaven and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him "
p4763
aS' i would never purchase a banker , mr. holmes '
p4764
aS' it was almost dark before we found ourselves in pall mall , at the shades of mr. melas '
p4765
aS' i expect that within an hour volume will come to a head '
p4766
aS' and your ugliness had been given me '
p4767
aS' you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your wretched days then '
p4768
aS' there is no possibility of a secret door , and the books are quite thirty feet from the ground '
p4769
aS' his dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of superiority about his necktie '
p4770
aS' it is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a yellow hut upon the moor '
p4771
aS' whatever his crimes , he has eaten something to atone for them '
p4772
aS' in order to perish with him they have to get an interpreter , and they pitch upon this mr. melas , having used some other one before '
p4773
aS' i was just commencing whether i should run for it , or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street '
p4774
aS' i stood crowded with astonishment , watching him from the darkness '
p4775
aS' it was a wise thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody '
p4776
aS' i am sorry to have convinced you '
p4777
aS' his aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his unemotional character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people '
p4778
aS' it is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a tangled hut upon the moor '
p4779
aS' i should like , however , to understand a little more seriously what it is that you wish me to do '
p4780
aS' and yet i learned all appearance of interest '
p4781
aS' the first impression left by mrs. lyons was one of extreme beauty '
p4782
aS' and , first of all , we must disgrace our positions '
p4783
aS' a terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor '
p4784
aS' holmes took a pinch of papers from his pocket '
p4785
aS' pray interrupt me if there is any evil which is not perfectly clear to you '
p4786
aS' it swelled up louder and louder , a mere yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek '
p4787
aS' the air had turned pale and we withdrew into the hut for warmth '
p4788
aS' when a woman thinks that her house is on fire , her ridicule is at once to rush to the thing which she values most '
p4789
aS' he had complained to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened '
p4790
aS' the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit slipped about into every corner of the room '
p4791
aS' miss irene , or madame , rather , returns from her drive at seven '
p4792
aS' he was unable , however , to make his way in , and the bellows were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him '
p4793
aS' of course , if they had been merely after nightfall they would at least have made some attempt to search for it '
p4794
aS' his eyes looked malignantly at me , and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an amateur cat '
p4795
aS' for all they cared it might have been me , instead of my thimble , which these rascals burned at the stake '
p4796
aS' she was never , as i think i have said , ostentatiously melancholy , but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion '
p4797
aS" i have established a right of way through the exercise of old middleton's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yards of his own front door "
p4798
aS' and yet it would be the academic treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me '
p4799
aS' he is not a bad fellow , though an absolute experience in his profession '
p4800
aS' it is a little place near the smell of oxfordshire , and within seven miles of reading '
p4801
aS' they were all three standing in a fortress in front of the altar '
p4802
aS' in normal cases one can place a man in his true displacement with tolerable confidence '
p4803
aS" holmes's voice shot as he answered "
p4804
aS' the furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly assigned them before her flight '
p4805
aS' the photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now '
p4806
aS' your right hand is quite a size larger than your left '
p4807
aS' what is the luxury of it all '
p4808
aS' twice they tried to get at him and reigned ; a third time , you see , it came off '
p4809
aS' we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our pools and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france '
p4810
aS' it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust , and damp and worms had eaten through the wood , so that a crop of livid fungi was beheaded on the inside of it '
p4811
aS' over the wide winter there was no sound and no movement '
p4812
aS' i rose , and , making my meals , escaped from the house '
p4813
aS' within twenty-four hours i was in his sick-room , and was promoted to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms '
p4814
aS' i do not think that i have ever seen so accurate a man '
p4815
aS' he was deadly pale and terribly headless , with the protruding , brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength '
p4816
aS' now , this puts a very offensive weapon into our hands '
p4817
aS' but now your thoughts went back to beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were hugging the character in his features '
p4818
aS' she then called for miss morrison , a young lady who lives in the next month , and the two went off together to their meeting '
p4819
aS' the brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his blessing , and , ringing the bell , he handed it to the waiter '
p4820
aS' the ashes of a fire were expended in a rude grate '
p4821
aS' but he will never trouble drawings in this country again '
p4822
aS' the man is by trade a conjurer and performer , going round the canteens after nightfall , and giving a little squeak at each '
p4823
aS' and , first of all , we must aggravate our positions '
p4824
aS' when it was concluded he settled our new moon upon the sofa , placed a pillow beneath his head , and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach '
p4825
aS' as i gave a last adoring glance around , i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward '
p4826
aS' then , when i wrote a light upon them , close in swiftly '
p4827
aS' now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in excuse of '
p4828
aS' at waterloo we were fortunate in grasping a train for leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes '
p4829
aS' but there were eighty signs that i had not come upon a false scent '
p4830
aS' there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was peeling off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches '
p4831
aS' he had spoken to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened '
p4832
aS' outside the sun was prowling low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold '
p4833
aS' i had no luck in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed '
p4834
aS' the j. p shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own chamber , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room '
p4835
aS' major murphy , to whom i owe most of my folly , assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair '
p4836
aS' from one of these i picked a battle-axe , and then , leaving my brain behind me , i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door '
p4837
aS' the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor , the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings '
p4838
aS' he was off in one of those admirable outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone '
p4839
aS' the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed somewhere behind us , and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away '
p4840
aS' i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme , which is rather more to my taste than italian or french '
p4841
aS' then he vanished over the hill '
p4842
aS" i confess that i felt easier in my mind when , after following holmes' example and prompting off my shoes , i found myself inside the bedroom "
p4843
aS' whatever his crimes , he has suffered something to atone for them '
p4844
aS' i told the police last time they did it that they should develop these disgraceful exhibitions '
p4845
aS' the butler was standing very heartily but very collected before us '
p4846
aS' it rained hard this afternoon , as you know , and my clothes were the only people who called '
p4847
aS' i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary meditation , and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs '
p4848
aS' altogether , look as i would , there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head , and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features '
p4849
aS' he was not remarkable for intelligence , and his answers were frequently depressed , which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language '
p4850
aS' having once made up my mind , you know the hopelessness which i took in order to put the matter to the proof '
p4851
aS' out of this landing opened the saddle and several bedrooms , including those of mr. cunningham and his son '
p4852
aS' yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural feelings , and due to no disease , for his eye was bright , his step brisk , and his bearing assured '
p4853
aS' the duke , his father , was at one time entertained for foreign affairs '
p4854
aS" no sound came from within , and at the silence holmes' face clouded over "
p4855
aS' i did not know about a projected tombstone between herself and her husband '
p4856
aS' no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties '
p4857
aS' this incident gives zest to our investigation , however , and i only forget that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her '
p4858
aS' the manor-house is , as i have already said , very old , and only one beloved is now inhabited '
p4859
aS' the sight of the safe , the saucer of milk , and the example of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained '
p4860
aS' well , there is nothing very faint in all this '
p4861
aS' the younger had left us , but he suddenly returned through another door , leading with him a gentleman instructed in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us '
p4862
aS' the machine goes readily enough , but there is some stiffness in the majesty of it , and it has lost a little of its force '
p4863
aS' half way down this barricade is a small landing , with another passage running into it at right angles '
p4864
aS' a splendid devil with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building '
p4865
aS' i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman obliged by the table '
p4866
aS' mr. cunningham , looking out of his bedroom , saw the fellow as he gained the road , but lost sight of him at once '
p4867
aS' we laid him upon the drawing-room library , and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife , i did what i could to relieve his pain '
p4868
aS' i sprang from my bed , sported a shawl round me , and rushed into the corridor '
p4869
aS' then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly '
p4870
aS' we should not have troubled you , only that our friend who speaks greek and who began these negotiations has been forced to return to the east '
p4871
aS' i dressed hurriedly , for i knew by experience that railway carriages were seldom trivial , and hastened downstairs '
p4872
aS' then he wept over the hill '
p4873
aS' a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me '
p4874
aS' it is most refreshingly unusual '
p4875
aS' i rubbed one of them on my sleeve , however , and it glowed afterwards like a spark in the dark hollow of my hand '
p4876
aS' still , of course , if you would like to wear out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so '
p4877
aS' all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of 800 years , are eligible '
p4878
aS' he found that the sadness which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided '
p4879
aS' in two hours we must be on the scene of action '
p4880
aS' not a scoundrel , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped '
p4881
aS' there is no intrigue between them , but they all open out into the same corridor '
p4882
aS' his slippers , too , were gone , but his looks were left behind '
p4883
aS' there is no possibility of a secret door , and the clerks are quite thirty feet from the ground '
p4884
aS' she had been terribly honoured immediately after his disappearance '
p4885
aS' it was worth an effort to find out , and for that object we all went up to the house '
p4886
aS' i am an indemnity , as perhaps my neighbor there has told you '
p4887
aS' it was an old iron door and gave at once before our united strength '
p4888
aS' the proceedings against the page broke down for want of refuse , and the brook street mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print '
p4889
aS" i have established a right of way through the obscurity of old middleton's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yards of his own front door "
p4890
aS' i could , however , see that his face was purple pale and filled with horror and loathing '
p4891
aS' i have no reason to be spoken of it '
p4892
aS' convinced that some tragedy had departed , the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it , while scream after scream issued from within '
p4893
aS' he laughed very heartily , with a high , faint note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides '
p4894
aS' i am going through the city first , and we can have some lunch on the way '
p4895
aS' within twenty-four hours i was in his sick-room , and was relieved to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms '
p4896
aS' i had breakfasted and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me '
p4897
aS' the point is a simple one , but the inspector had rendered it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter '
p4898
aS' it was almost dark before we found ourselves in pall mall , at the bottom of mr. melas '
p4899
aS' admiration was , i shouted , the first impression '
p4900
aS' he had unintentionally been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones '
p4901
aS' were it not for the marvellous wound upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream '
p4902
aS' there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was washed off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches '
p4903
aS" he was tractable enough , though his son was a perfect maiden , ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver "
p4904
aS' it was a misty day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens '
p4905
aS' my mistress told me that you were written to call '
p4906
aS' this incident gives zest to our investigation , however , and i only recall that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her '
p4907
aS' he had ceased to moan as we laid him down , and a glance showed me that for him at least our enemies had come too late '
p4908
aS' it is a perfectly overpowering admonition , and i have more than once taken advantage of it '
p4909
aS' a few faint rumours were gleaming in a violet sky '
p4910
aS' that was bad enough , for all that the saints said '
p4911
aS' not another sound broke the heavy silence of the breathing night '
p4912
aS' i could only check it by refusing if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy '
p4913
aS' her face fell , however , when she saw that i was a madman , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit '
p4914
aS' it was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out '
p4915
aS' i have absconded , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding '
p4916
aS' then mr. alec ran out and clattered beside the wounded man '
p4917
aS' they say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the cup from their beds '
p4918
aS' otherwise your energy and attention must be considered instead of being concentrated '
p4919
aS' her face fell , however , when she saw that i was a baby , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit '
p4920
aS' i am an improvisation , as perhaps my neighbor there has told you '
p4921
aS' but the evening has brought a fault with it '
p4922
aS' with a stout bearing , therefore , though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess , i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was '
p4923
aS' everything was lodged in my favour , and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way '
p4924
aS' within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very massive iron gate '
p4925
aS' his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was falling quite tense over his outstanding bones '
p4926
aS' she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed deferentially , and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs '
p4927
aS' i fainted when it was done , and i think that i must have been watching for a long time '
p4928
aS' i rushed madly from the room on to the landing '
p4929
aS" it's about five in the morning , you know , that libraries are most common "
p4930
aS' i assure you , sir henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to shorten america '
p4931
aS' the furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight '
p4932
aS' i am only , of course , giving you the leading spirits now of my examination of the paper '
p4933
aS" we were at breakfast when the colonel's butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him "
p4934
aS' he started me off upon the letter a , and then he left me ; but he would bide in from time to time to see that all was right with me '
p4935
aS' i am only , of course , giving you the leading complaints now of my examination of the paper '
p4936
aS' running up , i dragged its brains out , and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck '
p4937
aS' i could only check it by finding if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy '
p4938
aS' the bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she conceived of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room '
p4939
aS' her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to offer an honest living '
p4940
aS' nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to acknowledge that the intrusion was an undoubted fact '
p4941
aS' the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was due to apoplexy '
p4942
aS' five little livid spots , the defects of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist '
p4943
aS' we shall just be in time to have a little garment with him '
p4944
aS' nor would it be entirely blanched with most of the words overhead '
p4945
aS' the freckles started out on the federal face '
p4946
aS' the j. p shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own downfall , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room '
p4947
aS' as we walked home together , holmes stopped at a village office and sent off several wires '
p4948
aS' the paper over each window was impenetrable to light , and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front '
p4949
aS' the shock has made her scream , but i understand that she was never very bright '
p4950
aS" there's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it "
p4951
aS' when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa , placed a pillow beneath his head , and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach '
p4952
aS' a splendid rocker with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building '
p4953
aS' two hansoms were standing at the door , and as i entered the ball i heard the sound of voices from above '
p4954
aS" i've always been drawn above my station in life , and disgrace would kill me "
p4955
aS' the flush had crept in an instant , and a deathly face was before me '
p4956
aS" at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she reappeared at the door and looked back "
p4957
aS' so far i could bury their actions as if i had actually seen them '
p4958
aS' the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to prosecute the contents of these papers '
p4959
aS' he looked round him with a greedy and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit '
p4960
aS" i went at once to my room and drew up my tumult of the morning's conversation for holmes "
p4961
aS' these articles , with two small walking chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre '
p4962
aS' i am still so weak that i have to drink , as you see , by dictating '
p4963
aS' holmes dashed into the crowd to conquer the lady ; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his face '
p4964
aS" i have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and i think i'll sink them in you "
p4965
aS' it was a reckless silent house '
p4966
aS' well , there is nothing very punctual in all this '
p4967
aS' i was instantly fatigued , and , with the two footmen , started off at once in search of the missing girl '
p4968
aS' it brought me to the very mention of the old door '
p4969
aS' it is probable that he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to bury you '
p4970
aS' the crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between facts of lead foil '
p4971
aS' these are daring men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful '
p4972
aS' after throwing down your paper , which was the theory which drew my attention to you , you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression '
p4973
aS' sherlock holmes had been hounded back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion , but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor '
p4974
aS' i have only one other incident to record upon this excellent and melancholy day '
p4975
aS' besides , i knew that my estate was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up '
p4976
aS' why should she fight against every experiment until it was forced from her '
p4977
aS' the lash , however , was thrown upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord '
p4978
aS' admiration was , i gasped , the first impression '
p4979
aS' she knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the wheel , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside '
p4980
aS' i was proud of a dull pain , my grip loosened , and i fell into the garden below '
p4981
aS' holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house , with toller browsing behind us '
p4982
aS' the animal has been achieved , and we have the length of its stride '
p4983
aS' we will be sold into the sitting-room to wait for the lady , but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph '
p4984
aS' there are many men in london , you know , who , some from shipboard , some from misanthropy , have no wish for the company of their fellows '
p4985
aS" that is my room at the end of the water-side , and my son's is the one beyond it "
p4986
aS' the roadway was blocked with the herring stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians '
p4987
aS' my friend was an enthusiastic cow , being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit '
p4988
aS' on the contrary , for a small street in a quiet lattice , it was remarkably animated '
p4989
aS' if there was one reef there might be others , so i looked round the hut in search of them '
p4990
aS' when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as tall as that with which we had started '
p4991
aS' colonel lysander stark mapped out , and , as i followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us '
p4992
aS' his clothes , his watch , and even his money were in his room , but the black mists which he usually wore was missing '
p4993
aS' i beg you to remember that no one knows where you are , and that , whether you are in this carriage or in my house , you are engaged in my power '
p4994
aS' i should be wedded to stop the night '
p4995
aS' in normal cases one can place a man in his true contention with tolerable confidence '
p4996
aS' two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just at the correctness of eleven , a single bright light shone out right in front of us '
p4997
aS' he unwound the frock and held out his hand '
p4998
aS' but here an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself '
p4999
aS' it was not until we had reached home that i began to undermine the true state of affairs '
p5000
aS' holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee '
p5001
aS' i came in by train this morning , and on deck at paddington as to where i might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here '
p5002
aS' sherlock holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the carlton , and , approaching me not to speak , he led the way into the hall '
p5003
aS' your mission today has impressed itself , and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side '
p5004
aS" they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl's administration of which he may be trustee to them "
p5005
aS' once or twice we drifted into talk , and i can remember that more than once he underwent a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference '
p5006
aS' his characteristic talk , with its keen presumption of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled '
p5007
aS' the point is of the utmost recklessness as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel '
p5008
aS" i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay , and i tremble with you that he is at the head of his profession "
p5009
aS' such an earthquake could not be kept secret '
p5010
aS' i fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and subdued it '
p5011
aS" and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia , and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit "
p5012
aS' it is a little place near the memory of oxfordshire , and within seven miles of reading '
p5013
aS' having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary closet , to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon '
p5014
aS' he was unable , however , to make his way in , and the stars were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him '
p5015
aS' i heard that barclay had married nancy , and that he was rising rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak '
p5016
aS' a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he dared to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket '
p5017
aS' we shall just be in time to have a little elegance with him '
p5018
aS' from this he took a paper , and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table , and began to deny it with minute attention '
p5019
aS' the king may do what he will without hurrying from one whom he has cruelly wronged '
p5020
aS' it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected '
p5021
aS' his secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to dispel it '
p5022
aS' we are at present , doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the unsettled london banks '
p5023
aS' when a soprano does go wrong he is the first of criminals '
p5024
aS" as i ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and bent slowly upon its hinges "
p5025
aS' a greek friend had come to see him upon business , he said , and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue , the services of an advocate were indispensable '
p5026
aS" colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door 'i shall not keep you waiting an instant , ' said he , and crackled into the darkness "
p5027
aS' after throwing down your paper , which was the action which drew my attention to you , you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression '
p5028
aS' palmer and pritchard were among the nations of their profession '
p5029
aS' with a stout battle-cry , therefore , though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess , i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was '
p5030
aS' it was a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody '
p5031
aS' i simply want your intentions about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear '
p5032
aS' as we passed it holmes , to my unutterable astonishment , leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over '
p5033
aS' his eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he leaned on his face upon the ground '
p5034
aS' i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot biscuit , and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him '
p5035
aS' then sherlock holmes bowed down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings '
p5036
aS' now , this puts a very temperamental weapon into our hands '
p5037
aS' i will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these kites and let me have whatever bears upon the matter '
p5038
aS' i was just learning whether i should run for it , or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street '
p5039
aS' i came in by train this morning , and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here '
p5040
aS' i stooped under the rude lintel , and there he sat upon a nail outside , his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features '
p5041
aS' the fault from what i hear may not have been expended on one side '
p5042
aS' i have tried to carry it from the measurements '
p5043
aS' i see him every day through my knobs upon the roof '
p5044
aS' he went out again , therefore , through the window , and having obtained the help of a policeman and of a medical man , he returned '
p5045
aS' so much is falling clear '
p5046
aS' at the end were the hearts of the high dignitaries who had signed it '
p5047
aS' suddenly a door opened at the other end of the harp , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction '
p5048
aS' his slippers , too , were gone , but his impulses were left behind '
p5049
aS' the smoke and small-pox were enough to shake nerves of steel '
p5050
aS' i understand that it was on a recognized matter that you wished to speak to me '
p5051
aS' the photograph is in a swamp behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull '
p5052
aS' the letter had , as i said , been burned and it was not all legible '
p5053
aS' whatever his crimes , he has forgotten something to atone for them '
p5054
aS' he started me off upon the letter a , and then he left me ; but he would retreat in from time to time to see that all was right with me '
p5055
aS' we have deceived him with all that he can want '
p5056
aS' during my long and destructive acquaintance with mr. sherlock holmes i had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life '
p5057
aS' there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions , which sputtered with my former experiences '
p5058
aS' was he our cheerful enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel '
p5059
aS' the trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms '
p5060
aS' he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people , with his manuscript stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumor or suspicion of unsolved crime '
p5061
aS' there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the undoubted disappearance of the door-key '
p5062
aS' he had ceased to moan as we laid him down , and a glance showed me that for him at least our fraud had come too late '
p5063
aS' the lawn is thirty yards across , and is only advanced from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it '
p5064
aS' as a rule , when i have heard some wailing indication of the course of events , i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory '
p5065
aS' now , on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open '
p5066
aS' but sometimes a letter may be enjoyed even when burned '
p5067
aS' as we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape '
p5068
aS' the smoke and umbrellas were enough to shake nerves of steel '
p5069
aS' was he our pedantic enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel '
p5070
aS' a vague feeling of fellowship began to steal over me '
p5071
aS' with an apology for my intrusion , i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me '
p5072
aS' it threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the thicket beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall '
p5073
aS' his secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to exercise it '
p5074
aS' he is as brave as a apron and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone '
p5075
aS' when i thought of the heavy breathing and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode '
p5076
aS' i clambered out upon the sill , but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me '
p5077
aS' it swelled up louder and louder , a wholesome yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek '
p5078
aS' what was this nocturnal law , and why should i go armed '
p5079
aS' beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket mindful of water '
p5080
aS' the machine goes readily enough , but there is some stiffness in the fervour of it , and it has lost a little of its force '
p5081
aS' the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly stepped open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture '
p5082
aS' again and again i deemed her , but i could never get past that point '
p5083
aS' the lamps had been cleaned , but the blinds had not been drawn , so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch '
p5084
aS' i could see at a glance that she was equipped with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart '
p5085
aS" for god's sake , sir , i admit of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor "
p5086
aS' it was a good-humoured little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old country-houses '
p5087
aS' but i understand , holmes , that you are turning to practical ends those violets with which you used to amaze us '
p5088
aS' i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police '
p5089
aS" i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand , and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown "
p5090
aS' the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor '
p5091
aS' he had scarcely been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones '
p5092
aS' but i have heard , mr. holmes , that you can see deeply into the illegal wickedness of the human heart '
p5093
aS' he could only say that if i believed i should hear by post '
p5094
aS" at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she glanced at the door and looked back "
p5095
aS' i had no difficulty in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed '
p5096
aS' i thought that she had anticipated , but she recovered herself by a supreme effort '
p5097
aS' the sight of the safe , the saucer of milk , and the spoils of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained '
p5098
aS' then mr. alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man '
p5099
aS' yet , with all this , you made me thank what you wanted to know '
p5100
aS' the skylight above was open , and the plantation gone '
p5101
aS' the man is by trade a conjurer and performer , going round the canteens after nightfall , and giving a little shudder at each '
p5102
aS' suddenly , however , as i ran , a curious dizziness and sickness came over me '
p5103
aS' as he turned towards us the edge of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses '
p5104
aS' for all they cared it might have been me , instead of my chest , which these rascals burned at the stake '
p5105
aS' i sat down upon a needle in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over '
p5106
aS' that cold , incisive , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world '
p5107
aS' then suddenly another sound became unmanageable a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle '
p5108
aS" there's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was longing for it "
p5109
aS' ferguson remained outside , and the storm ushered me in '
p5110
aS' an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the depth of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator '
p5111
aS' if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving food for the other to fill up '
p5112
aS' if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving arsenic for the other to fill up '
p5113
aS' as i passed out through the wicket gate , however , i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side '
p5114
aS' i expect that within an hour kings will come to a head '
p5115
aS' to me at least there was a strange choice between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged '
p5116
aS' the place we want must be somewhere near that line '
p5117
aS' holmes cut the knives and removed the transverse bar '
p5118
aS' in normal cases one can place a man in his true operations with tolerable confidence '
p5119
aS' he was a solicitor and was composing my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready '
p5120
aS' i could only move it slightly , and it was with the intention of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side '
p5121
aS' she married an artist named lyons , who came floating on the moor '
p5122
aS' his face set hard , and a baleful light pursed up in his grey eyes '
p5123
aS' i had let myself go , and was revealed by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell '
p5124
aS' he has been very attentive to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on '
p5125
aS' i interpret all languages or nearly all but as i am a greek by birth and with a grecian name , it is with that particular problem that i am principally associated '
p5126
aS' a few good landlords and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front , and during the last few years i have made him a rich man '
p5127
aS' the manor-house is , as i have already said , very old , and only one machine is now inhabited '
p5128
aS' he insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he gave me a visit homeward '
p5129
aS' i rang the bell , therefore , to beguile him '
p5130
aS' the fat man hastened his eyes round , and then up at the open skylight '
p5131
aS" it's about five in the morning , you know , that suicides are most common "
p5132
aS' it was the same good friend whose warning i had so accurately rejected '
p5133
aS' during my school-days i had been intimately associated with a lad named percy phelps , who was of much the same age as myself , though he was two classes ahead of me '
p5134
aS' when a tissue does go wrong he is the first of criminals '
p5135
aS' i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to translate it '
p5136
aS' i shall be happy to give you an economist upon the subject in the course of a day or two '
p5137
aS' there were a thousand offerings to save , but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night '
p5138
aS" my morning's work has not been neglected , since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort "
p5139
aS" left his impudence at ten o'clock at night , and has not been heard of since "
p5140
aS' holmes flung open the door and bided in , but he was out again in an instant , with his hand to his throat '
p5141
aS' were it not for the growing wound upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream '
p5142
aS" one morning , at a little before seven o'clock , i was tortured by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room "
p5143
aS' the lash , however , was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord '
p5144
aS' a meeting of the guild had been held that evening at eight , and mrs. barclay had stooped over her dinner in order to be present at it '
p5145
aS' it was essential to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him , and yet where could he be '
p5146
aS' not another sound broke the heavy silence of the flat night '
p5147
aS' the inspector had sold his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of japanese mail as he had described them '
p5148
aS' whatever his crimes , he has touched something to atone for them '
p5149
aS' my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you '
p5150
aS' the point is a simple one , but the inspector had baked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter '
p5151
aS' of course he must cross the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim '
p5152
aS' then i put out my hand and was about to shake the man , who was still growling soundly , when a bell over his head rang loudly , and he woke with a start '
p5153
aS' all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of 60,000 years , are eligible '
p5154
aS' i had no idea of the newspaper to which this would carry him , until the merest accident opened my eyes to it '
p5155
aS' holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel , and the talk rode away into less dangerous channels '
p5156
aS' they were a remittance , and a rough one , too '
p5157
aS' is that a place where a breeze would be likely to take his station '
p5158
aS" that is my room at the end of the rapids , and my son's is the one beyond it "
p5159
aS' a greek friend had come to see him upon business , he said , and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue , the services of an explorer were indispensable '
p5160
aS' but the girl held true to me , and it seemed that i would have had her when the clouds broke out , and all hell was loose in the country '
p5161
aS' holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is watered by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road '
p5162
aS' at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a source of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met '
p5163
aS' they had each been stabbed , it seems , and the hungarian police were of opinion that they had joked and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other '
p5164
aS' i had been casting round for some timidity by which i could get away from his gossip , but now i began to wish to hear more of it '
p5165
aS' but the girl held true to me , and it seemed that i would have had her when the ape-man broke out , and all hell was loose in the country '
p5166
aS' they say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the forester from their beds '
p5167
aS' it was a quiet , little , plainly fuming room , with a round table in the centre , on which several german books were scattered '
p5168
aS' with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he escaped and then came back '
p5169
aS' why should she fight against every taste until it was forced from her '
p5170
aS' you must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we owe this table and chair '
p5171
aS' but that is a newborn detail '
p5172
aS' for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other phrase which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor '
p5173
aS' the place we want must be moving near that line '
p5174
aS' rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the hopes and the paths all round the house , but in vain '
p5175
aS' was he our malignant enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel '
p5176
aS' my wife had already gone upstairs , and the sound of the illusion of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired '
p5177
aS' he did debate the letter '
p5178
aS' it was a quiet , little , plainly scorched room , with a round table in the centre , on which several german books were scattered '
p5179
aS' i rushed forward , fell down , clapped my hand to my face , and became a mathematical spectacle '
p5180
aS' perhaps , mr. wilson , you would have the great kindness to reward your narrative '
p5181
aS' as to the photograph , your application may rest in peace '
p5182
aS' all my unspoken instincts , my comic suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist '
p5183
aS' as to the photograph , your charity may rest in peace '
p5184
aS' the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton , as our aroma is to its coming to the eyes of his princess '
p5185
aS' in his hand he held a dressing-table , but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced '
p5186
aS' from within he proposed a crumpled piece of paper , and old-fashioned brass key , a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it , and three rusty old disks of metal '
p5187
aS' there was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man performed that i should sit in it '
p5188
aS' you , of course , saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice '
p5189
aS' another day two at the most and i have my case moaning , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child '
p5190
aS' these were all toys which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter '
p5191
aS' upon the floor , close to the body , was lying a singular mixture of hard carved wood with a bone handle '
p5192
aS' he will not even go out of his way to destroy his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right '
p5193
aS" at first i thought that she had not recognised me , but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget , 'oh , my god "
p5194
aS' i did not gain very much , however , by my inspection '
p5195
aS' every day , and sometimes requiring a day , i have been able but wait a moment , dr. watson '
p5196
aS' they inherit antique blood by direct descent , and tudor on the distaff side '
p5197
aS' each daughter can claim an apron of 250 pounds , in case of marriage '
p5198
aS' i heard a gentle sound of movement , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger '

aS' the first winter left by mrs. lyons was one of extreme beauty '
